              "['I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\\nsettled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\\noff his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my\\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the\\nusual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call\\nourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called\\nme.',\n",
              " 'I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\\nSpaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\\nmy father or mother knew what became of me.',\n",
              " 'Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head\\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who\\nwas very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\\nhouse-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me\\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;\\nand my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,\\nthe commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and\\npersuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be\\nsomething fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the\\nlife of misery which was to befall me.',\n",
              " 'My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into\\nhis chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very\\nwarmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a\\nmere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father’s house and my\\nnative country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of\\nraising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and\\npleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or\\nof aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\\nall either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the\\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the\\nworld, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries\\nand hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of\\nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy\\nof the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness\\nof this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life\\nwhich all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\\nmiserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they\\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the\\nstandard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\\nriches.',\n",
              " 'He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that\\nthe middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so\\nmany vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they\\nwere not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of\\nbody or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\\nextravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries,\\nand mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon\\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the\\nmiddle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all\\nkind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a\\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\\nit, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not\\nsold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed\\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor\\nenraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of\\nambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently\\nthrough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without\\nthe bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day’s\\nexperience to know it more sensibly.',\n",
              " 'After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\\nmanner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into\\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\\ninto the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and\\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to\\ngive me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I\\nhad my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the\\narmy, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to\\npray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this\\nfoolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure\\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\\nbe none to assist in my recovery.',\n",
              " 'I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\\nhimself—I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully,\\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\\nmoved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so\\nfull he could say no more to me.',\n",
              " 'I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be\\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\\nsettle at home according to my father’s desire. But alas! a few days\\nwore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father’s further\\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\\nhim. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my\\nresolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her\\na little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts\\nwere so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle\\nto anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father\\nhad better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I\\nwas now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a\\ntrade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never\\nserve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master\\nbefore my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my\\nfather to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did\\nnot like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double\\ndiligence, to recover the time that I had lost.',\n",
              " 'This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would\\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so\\nmuch for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such\\nthing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and\\ntender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in\\nshort, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might\\ndepend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she\\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have\\nit to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.',\n",
              " 'Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard\\nafterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my\\nfather, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh,\\n“That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes\\nabroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can\\ngive no consent to it.”']"

              " 'In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of\\nexchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the\\nestate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him\\n(the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son\\nfor his life, which I had promised them, and which the plantation was\\nto make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part of\\na life of fortune and adventure—a life of Providence’s chequer-work,\\nand of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like\\nof; beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of\\nit ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.',\n",
              " 'Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I\\nwas past running any more hazards—and so, indeed, I had been, if other\\ncircumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had\\nno family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted\\nfresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet\\nI could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to\\nbe upon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong\\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards\\nwere in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me\\nfrom it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she\\nprevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two nephews,\\nthe children of one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having\\nsomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a\\nsettlement of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I\\nplaced with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a\\nsensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,\\nand sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as\\nold as I was, to further adventures myself.',\n",
              " 'In the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and\\nmy nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged\\nme to go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was\\nin the year 1694.',\n",
              " 'In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\\nthe Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I\\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were\\nsubjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them—a\\nhistory, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful\\naccidents as my own part—particularly, also, as to their battles with\\nthe Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the\\nimprovement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made\\nan attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and five\\nwomen prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young\\nchildren on the island.',\n",

              " 'Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to\\nmyself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively\\nas they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged\\nthem not to leave the place, I left them there.',\n",
              " 'From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which\\nI bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides\\nother supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for\\nservice, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,\\nI promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of\\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting—which I\\nafterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and\\ndiligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart\\nfor them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them\\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again\\nwere considerably increased.',\n",

My father, who\\nwas very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\\nhouse-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me\\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;\\nand my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,\\nthe commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and\\npersuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be\\nsomething fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the\\nlife of misery which was to befall me.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 3,\n            'f': \"3\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 3,\n            'f': \"3\",\n        },\n\"My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into\\nhis chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very\\nwarmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a\\nmere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father\\u2019s house and my\\nnative country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of\\nraising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and\\npleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or\\nof aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\\nall either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the\\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the\\nworld, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries\\nand hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of\\nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy\\nof the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness\\nof this state by this one thing\\u2014viz. that this was the state of life\\nwhich all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\\nmiserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they\\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the\\nstandard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\\nriches.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 4,\n            'f': \"4\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 4,\n            'f': \"4\",\n        },\n\"He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that\\nthe middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so\\nmany vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they\\nwere not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of\\nbody or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\\nextravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries,\\nand mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon\\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the\\nmiddle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all\\nkind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a\\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\\nit, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not\\nsold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed\\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor\\nenraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of\\nambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently\\nthrough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without\\nthe bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day\\u2019s\\nexperience to know it more sensibly.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\\nmanner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into\\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\\ninto the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and\\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to\\ngive me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I\\nhad my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the\\narmy, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to\\npray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this\\nfoolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure\\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\\nbe none to assist in my recovery.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 6,\n            'f': \"6\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 6,\n            'f': \"6\",\n        },\n\"I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\\nhimself\\u2014I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully,\\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\\nmoved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so\\nfull he could say no more to me.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 7,\n            'f': \"7\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 7,\n            'f': \"7\",\n        },\n\"I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be\\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\\nsettle at home according to my father\\u2019s desire. But alas! a few days\\nwore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father\\u2019s further\\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\\nhim. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my\\nresolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her\\na little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts\\nwere so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle\\nto anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father\\nhad better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I\\nwas now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a\\ntrade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never\\nserve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master\\nbefore my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my\\nfather to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did\\nnot like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double\\ndiligence, to recover the time that I had lost.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 8,\n            'f': \"8\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 8,\n            'f': \"8\",\n        },\n\"This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would\\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so\\nmuch for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such\\nthing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and\\ntender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in\\nshort, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might\\ndepend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she\\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have\\nit to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 9,\n            'f': \"9\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 9,\n            'f': \"9\",\n        },\n\"Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard\\nafterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my\\nfather, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh,\\n\\u201cThat boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes\\nabroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can\\ngive no consent to it.\\u201d\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"number\", \"parag_no\"], [\"string\", \"parag_raw\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n    ",

RESCUE OF PRISONERS FROM CANNIBALS\\n\\n\\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going\\nover with him to the continent that I told him we would go and make one\\nas big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word,\\nbut looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with\\nhim. He asked me again, \\u201cWhy you angry mad with Friday?\\u2014what me done?\\u201d\\nI asked him what he meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all.\\n\\u201cNo angry!\\u201d says he, repeating the words several times; \\u201cwhy send\\nFriday home away to my nation?\\u201d \\u201cWhy,\\u201d says I, \\u201cFriday, did not you say\\nyou wished you were there?\\u201d \\u201cYes, yes,\\u201d says he, \\u201cwish we both there;\\nno wish Friday there, no master there.\\u201d In a word, he would not think\\nof going there without me. \\u201cI go there, Friday?\\u201d says I; \\u201cwhat shall I\\ndo there?\\u201d He turned very quick upon me at this. \\u201cYou do great deal\\nmuch good,\\u201d says he; \\u201cyou teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;\\nyou tell them know God, pray God, and live new life.\\u201d \\u201cAlas, Friday!\\u201d\\nsays I, \\u201cthou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man\\nmyself.\\u201d \\u201cYes, yes,\\u201d says he, \\u201cyou teachee me good, you teachee them\\ngood.\\u201d \\u201cNo, no, Friday,\\u201d says I, \\u201cyou shall go without me; leave me\\nhere to live by myself, as I did before.\\u201d He looked confused again at\\nthat word; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he\\ntakes it up hastily, and gives it to me. \\u201cWhat must I do with this?\\u201d\\nsays I to him. \\u201cYou take kill Friday,\\u201d says he. \\u201cWhat must kill you\\nfor?\\u201d said I again. He returns very quick\\u2014\\u201cWhat you send Friday away\\nfor? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.\\u201d This he spoke so earnestly\\nthat I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered\\nthe utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I\\ntold him then and often after, that I would never send him away from me\\nif he was willing to stay with me.\\n\\nUpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to\\nme, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the\\nfoundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his\\nardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a\\nthing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least\\nthought or intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a\\nstrong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposition\\ngathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men\\nthere; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with\\nFriday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large\\nperiagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in\\nthe island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes,\\nbut even of good, large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to\\nget one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made, to\\navoid the mistake I committed at first. At last Friday pitched upon a\\ntree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was\\nfittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree\\nwe cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or\\nbetween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour\\nand smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out,\\nto make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools;\\nwhich, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in\\nabout a month\\u2019s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome;\\nespecially when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we\\ncut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this,\\nhowever, it cost us near a fortnight\\u2019s time to get her along, as it\\nwere inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was\\nin, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.\\n\\nWhen she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see\\nwith what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn\\nher, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might\\nventure over in her. \\u201cYes,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwe venture over in her very well,\\nthough great blow wind.\\u201d However I had a further design that he knew\\nnothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her\\nwith an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so\\nI pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the\\nplace, and which there were great plenty of in the island, and I set\\nFriday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and\\norder it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had\\nold sails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them\\nnow six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to\\npreserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use\\nfor them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten; and, indeed, most\\nof them were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared pretty\\ngood, and with these I went to work; and with a great deal of pains,\\nand awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at\\nlength made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a\\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little\\nshort sprit at the top, such as usually our ships\\u2019 long-boats sail\\nwith, and such as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I\\nhad to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in\\nthe first part of my story.\\n\\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and\\nfitting my masts and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a\\nsmall stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist if we should turn\\nto windward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern\\nof her to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew\\nthe usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself\\nwith so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though,\\nconsidering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I\\nthink it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.\\n\\nAfter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what\\nbelonged to the navigation of my boat; though he knew very well how to\\npaddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a\\nrudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and\\nagain in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this\\nway or that way as the course we sailed changed; I say when he saw this\\nhe stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I\\nmade all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor,\\nexcept that of the compass I could make him understand very little. On\\nthe other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or\\nnever any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a\\ncompass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the\\nshore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to\\nstir abroad either by land or sea.\\n\\nI was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in\\nthis place; though the three last years that I had this creature with\\nme ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being\\nquite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the\\nanniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for\\nHis mercies as at first: and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at\\nfirst, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies of\\nthe care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being\\neffectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression\\nupon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not\\nbe another year in this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry;\\ndigging, planting, and fencing as usual. I gathered and cured my\\ngrapes, and did every necessary thing as before.\\n\\nThe rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more within\\ndoors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we\\ncould, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the\\nbeginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the\\nshore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just\\nbig enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough\\nto float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam\\nacross the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay, dry as to\\nthe tide from the sea: and to keep the rain off we laid a great many\\nboughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a house; and\\nthus we waited for the months of November and December, in which I\\ndesigned to make my adventure.\\n\\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design\\nreturned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage.\\nAnd the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of\\nprovisions, being the stores for our voyage; and intended in a week or\\na fortnight\\u2019s time to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was\\nbusy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday,\\nand bid him to go to the sea-shore and see if he could find a turtle or\\na tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of\\nthe eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he\\ncame running back, and flew over my outer wall or fence, like one that\\nfelt not the ground or the steps he set his foot on; and before I had\\ntime to speak to him he cries out to me, \\u201cO master! O master! O sorrow!\\nO bad!\\u201d\\u2014\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter, Friday?\\u201d says I. \\u201cO yonder there,\\u201d says he,\\n\\u201cone, two, three canoes; one, two, three!\\u201d By this way of speaking I\\nconcluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there were but three.\\n\\u201cWell, Friday,\\u201d says I, \\u201cdo not be frightened.\\u201d So I heartened him up\\nas well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly\\nscared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for\\nhim, and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow\\ntrembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I comforted him\\nas well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and\\nthat they would eat me as well as him. \\u201cBut,\\u201d says I, \\u201cFriday, we must\\nresolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?\\u201d \\u201cMe shoot,\\u201d says he,\\n\\u201cbut there come many great number.\\u201d \\u201cNo matter for that,\\u201d said I again;\\n\\u201cour guns will fright them that we do not kill.\\u201d So I asked him\\nwhether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by\\nme, and do just as I bid him. He said, \\u201cMe die when you bid die,\\nmaster.\\u201d So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I\\nhad been so good a husband of my rum that I had a great deal left. When\\nwe had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we\\nalways carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small\\npistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two\\nslugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a\\nbrace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my\\nside, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I\\ntook my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see\\nwhat I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass that there were\\none-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that\\ntheir whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these\\nthree human bodies: a barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than,\\nas I had observed, was usual with them. I observed also that they had\\nlanded, not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer\\nto my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came\\nalmost close down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman\\nerrand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that\\nI came down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to\\nthem and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He had\\nnow got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the\\ndram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he\\nwould die when I bid die.\\n\\nIn this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,\\nbetween us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three\\nguns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns\\nmyself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of\\nrum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and\\nbullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and\\nnot to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the\\nmeantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my\\nright hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into\\nthe wood, so that I could come within shot of them before I should be\\ndiscovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.\\n\\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to\\nabate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their\\nnumber, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was\\nsuperior to them\\u2014nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my\\nthoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in\\nto go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done\\nor intended me any wrong? who, as to me, were innocent, and whose\\nbarbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token,\\nindeed, of God\\u2019s having left them, with the other nations of that part\\nof the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did\\nnot call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less\\nan executioner of His justice\\u2014that whenever He thought fit He would\\ntake the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish\\nthem as a people for national crimes, but that, in the meantime, it was\\nnone of my business\\u2014that it was true Friday might justify it, because\\nhe was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very\\nparticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them\\u2014but I could\\nnot say the same with regard to myself. These things were so warmly\\npressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would\\nonly go and place myself near them that I might observe their barbarous\\nfeast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless\\nsomething offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I\\nwould not meddle with them.\\n\\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible\\nwariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched\\ntill I came to the skirts of the wood on the side which was next to\\nthem, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I\\ncalled softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was just at\\nthe corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if\\nhe could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came\\nimmediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed\\nthere\\u2014that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of\\ntheir prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a little from\\nthem, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the very soul\\nwithin me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the\\nbearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat.\\nI was filled with horror at the very naming of the white bearded man;\\nand going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay\\nupon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags,\\nor things like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on.\\n\\nThere was another tree and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty\\nyards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a\\nlittle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I\\nshould be within half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though\\nI was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty\\npaces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to\\nthe other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me\\na full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards.\\n\\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches\\nsat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the\\nother two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by\\nlimb to their fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands at\\nhis feet. I turned to Friday. \\u201cNow, Friday,\\u201d said I, \\u201cdo as I bid\\nthee.\\u201d Friday said he would. \\u201cThen, Friday,\\u201d says I, \\u201cdo exactly as you\\nsee me do; fail in nothing.\\u201d So I set down one of the muskets and the\\nfowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with\\nthe other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the\\nlike; then asking him if he was ready, he said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d \\u201cThen fire at\\nthem,\\u201d said I; and at the same moment I fired also.\\n\\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he\\nshot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I\\nkilled one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\\nconsternation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their\\nfeet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to\\nlook, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept\\nhis eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I\\ndid; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece,\\nand took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like; he saw me cock\\nand present; he did the same again. \\u201cAre you ready, Friday?\\u201d said I.\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d says he. \\u201cLet fly, then,\\u201d says I, \\u201cin the name of God!\\u201d and with\\nthat I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as\\nour pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small\\npistol-bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded that\\nthey ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody,\\nand most of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly\\nafter, though not quite dead.\\n\\n\\u201cNow, Friday,\\u201d says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up\\nthe musket which was yet loaded, \\u201cfollow me,\\u201d which he did with a great\\ndeal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself,\\nand Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I\\nshouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as\\nfast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded\\nwith arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,\\nas I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place where they\\nsat and the sea. The two butchers who were just going to work with him\\nhad left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible\\nfright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of\\nthe rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step\\nforwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running\\nabout forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and I thought he\\nhad killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat,\\nthough I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of\\nthem, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the\\nboat as if he had been dead.\\n\\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He\\nanswered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could\\nscarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it\\nhim, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a\\npiece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was:\\nand he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by\\nall the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for\\nhis deliverance. \\u201cSeignior,\\u201d said I, with as much Spanish as I could\\nmake up, \\u201cwe will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have\\nany strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.\\u201d He\\ntook them very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands,\\nbut, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers\\nlike a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the\\ntruth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures\\nwere so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell\\ndown for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt\\ntheir own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was\\nthe case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of\\nthem fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the\\nfright.\\n\\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep\\nmy charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword:\\nso I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we\\nfirst fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been\\ndischarged, which he did with great swiftness; and then giving him my\\nmusket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade them\\ncome to me when they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there\\nhappened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the\\nsavages, who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the\\nweapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it.\\nThe Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though\\nweak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great wounds\\non his head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in\\nwith him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword\\nout of his hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting\\nthe sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the\\nbody, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help\\nhim, could come near him.\\n\\nFriday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches,\\nwith no weapon in his hand but his hatchet: and with that he despatched\\nthose three who as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen,\\nand all the rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me\\nfor a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued\\ntwo of the savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to\\nrun, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,\\nand killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for him; and\\nthough he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam\\nwith all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which\\nthree in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died\\nor no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account\\nof the whole is as follows: Three killed at our first shot from the\\ntree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat;\\ntwo killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in\\nthe wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found\\ndropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase\\nof them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not\\ndead\\u2014twenty-one in all.\\n\\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and\\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he\\nhit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their\\ncanoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about their\\nescape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they should come\\nback perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by\\nmere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to\\none of their canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me: but when I\\nwas in the canoe I was surprised to find another poor creature lie\\nthere, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and\\nalmost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not\\nbeen able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard\\nneck and heels, and had been tied so long that he had really but little\\nlife in him.\\n\\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him\\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,\\nbut groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was\\nonly unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him I bade him\\nspeak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my\\nbottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of\\nhis being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when\\nFriday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have\\nmoved any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced\\nhim, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang;\\nthen cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then\\nsang and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good\\nwhile before I could make him speak to me or tell me what was the\\nmatter; but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his\\nfather.\\n\\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy\\nand filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his\\nfather, and of his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I\\ndescribe half the extravagances of his affection after this: for he\\nwent into the boat and out of the boat a great many times: when he went\\nin to him he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his\\nfather\\u2019s head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish\\nit; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with\\nthe binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I,\\nperceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub\\nthem with, which did them a great deal of good.\\n\\nThis affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\\nsavages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that\\nwe did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they\\ncould be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all\\nnight, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I\\ncould not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached\\ntheir own coast.\\n\\nBut to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I could\\nnot find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought\\nhe could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping\\nand laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then I asked him if\\nhe had given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, \\u201cNone;\\nugly dog eat all up self.\\u201d I then gave him a cake of bread out of a\\nlittle pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself;\\nbut he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my\\npocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them\\nfor his father. He had no sooner given his father these raisins but I\\nsaw him come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched,\\nfor he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say, he\\nran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;\\nand though I called, and hallooed out too after him, it was all\\none\\u2014away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back\\nagain, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer I found his\\npace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he came up to\\nme I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring\\nhis father some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or\\nloaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his\\nfather; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. The\\nwater revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given\\nhim, for he was fainting with thirst.\\n\\nWhen his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any\\nwater left. He said, \\u201cYes\\u201d; and I bade him give it to the poor\\nSpaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one\\nof the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed\\nvery weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade\\nof a tree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled\\nwith the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon\\nFriday\\u2019s coming to him with the water he sat up and drank, and took the\\nbread and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of\\nraisins. He looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and\\nthankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak,\\nnotwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could\\nnot stand up upon his feet\\u2014he tried to do it two or three times, but\\nwas really not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him;\\nso I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe\\nthem with rum, as he had done his father\\u2019s.\\n\\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or\\nperhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if\\nhis father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;\\nand at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,\\nand, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one\\ncould scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when\\nhe came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so\\nFriday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to\\nlet Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then\\nhe should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.\\nBut Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back,\\nand carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side\\nor gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then\\nlifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently\\nstepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the\\nshore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too;\\nso he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the\\nboat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to\\nhim, and asked him whither he went. He told me, \\u201cGo fetch more boat;\\u201d\\nso away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like\\nhim; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to\\nit by land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests\\nout of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to\\nwalk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.\\n\\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\\nbid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind\\nof hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up\\ntogether upon it between us.\\n\\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we\\nwere at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them\\nover, and I was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again,\\nand Friday and I, in about two hours\\u2019 time, made a very handsome tent,\\ncovered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in\\nthe space without our outward fence and between that and the grove of\\nyoung wood which I had planted; and here we made them two beds of such\\nthings as I had\\u2014viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to\\nlie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.\\n\\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;\\nand it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king\\nI looked. First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that\\nI had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were\\nperfectly subjected\\u2014I was absolutely lord and lawgiver\\u2014they all owed\\ntheir lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had\\nbeen occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three\\nsubjects, and they were of three different religions\\u2014my man Friday was\\na Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard\\nwas a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my\\ndominions. But this is by the way.\\n\\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given them\\nshelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take\\na yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,\\nto be killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into\\nsmall pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made\\nthem a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; and as I\\ncooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I\\ncarried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for\\nthem, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as\\nI could, cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter,\\nespecially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the\\nSpaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.\\n\\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of\\nthe canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for\\nwant of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I\\nordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay\\nopen to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him\\nto bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not\\nthink of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them if I went that\\nway; all which he punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance\\nof the savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce\\nknow where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to\\nthe place.\\n\\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\\nsubjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we\\nmight expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.\\nHis first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live\\nout the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of\\nnecessity be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they\\nwere as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were\\ncast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he\\nsaid he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully\\nfrightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the\\nfire, that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed\\nby thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two\\nwhich appeared\\u2014viz. Friday and I\\u2014were two heavenly spirits, or furies,\\ncome down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, he\\nknew; because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to\\nanother; for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could\\ndart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting\\nup the hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in the right;\\nfor, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages never attempted\\nto go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified with the\\naccounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the\\nsea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be\\ndestroyed with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and\\ntherefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept\\nalways upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now four of\\nus, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open\\nfield, at any time.\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1728,\n            'f': \"1728\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 16,\n            'f': \"16\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 16,\n            'f': \"16\",\n        },\n\". VISIT OF MUTINEERS\\n\\n\\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their\\ncoming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to\\nthe main into consideration; being likewise assured by Friday\\u2019s father\\nthat I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account,\\nif I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a\\nserious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there\\nwere sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been\\ncast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace,\\nindeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,\\nand, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage,\\nand found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to\\nthe Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was\\nchiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods they\\ncould meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board,\\nwhom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own men were\\ndrowned when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through\\ninfinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the\\ncannibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every moment.\\nHe told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly\\nuseless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the\\nsea having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used at\\ntheir first landing to provide themselves with some food.\\n\\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had\\nformed any design of making their escape. He said they had many\\nconsultations about it; but that having neither vessel nor tools to\\nbuild one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in\\ntears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a\\nproposal from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if\\nthey were all here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom, I\\nfeared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in\\ntheir hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of\\nman, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they\\nhad received so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I\\ntold him it would be very hard that I should be made the instrument of\\ntheir deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their\\nprisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a\\nsacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither;\\nand that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured\\nalive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be\\ncarried into the Inquisition. I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded,\\nif they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a barque\\nlarge enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils southward, or\\nto the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in requital,\\nthey should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force\\namong their own people, I might be ill-used for my kindness to them,\\nand make my case worse than it was before.\\n\\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their\\ncondition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that\\nhe believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that\\nshould contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he\\nwould go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,\\nand return again and bring me their answer; that he would make\\nconditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be\\nabsolutely under my direction as their commander and captain; and they\\nshould swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and\\ngo to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and to\\nbe directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed\\nsafely in such country as I intended, and that he would bring a\\ncontract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told\\nme he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me\\nas long as he lived till I gave him orders; and that he would take my\\nside to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least\\nbreach of faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them\\nvery civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest distress\\nimaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at\\nthe mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever\\nreturning to their own country; and that he was sure, if I would\\nundertake their relief, they would live and die by me.\\n\\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if\\npossible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to\\ntreat. But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard\\nhimself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one\\nhand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be\\nvery well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance\\nof his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus: he had\\nbeen with us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in\\nwhat manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my\\nsupport; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid\\nup; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was\\nnot sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was\\nincreased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his\\ncountrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come\\nover; and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if\\nwe should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of\\nAmerica; so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him\\nand the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could\\nspare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we\\nmight have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come;\\nfor want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think\\nthemselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into\\nanother. \\u201cYou know,\\u201d says he, \\u201cthe children of Israel, though they\\nrejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled\\neven against God Himself, that delivered them, when they came to want\\nbread in the wilderness.\\u201d\\n\\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\\nwith his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as\\nthe wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a\\nmonth\\u2019s time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much\\nland cured and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley\\non, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had\\nto spare: indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food\\nfor the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to say\\nreckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not\\nto be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.\\n\\nHaving now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us\\nout of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had\\nbeen very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found\\noccasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it\\nwas impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.\\nFor this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for\\nour work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I\\ncaused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to\\noversee and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable\\npains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to\\ndo the like, till they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak,\\nnear two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four\\ninches thick: what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine.\\n\\nAt the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats\\nas much as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard\\ngo out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our\\nturns), and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up\\nwith the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and\\nadded them to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the\\ngrapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in\\nthe sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of\\nthe sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and\\nthese, with our bread, formed a great part of our food\\u2014very good living\\ntoo, I assure you, for they are exceedingly nourishing.\\n\\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most\\nplentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was\\nenough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we\\nbrought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and\\nthe like in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food\\nto the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore\\nwith me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very\\nplentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of\\nthe world; that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus housed\\nand secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more\\nwicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard\\nwas very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I\\ndid not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no\\nneed of it.\\n\\nAnd now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I\\ngave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do\\nwith those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not\\nto bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself\\nand the old savage that he would in no way injure, fight with, or\\nattack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to\\nsend for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand\\nby him and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went\\nwould be entirely under and subjected to his command; and that this\\nshould be put in writing, and signed in their hands. How they were to\\nhave done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a\\nquestion which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard\\nand the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the\\ncanoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were brought\\nin, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave\\neach of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges\\nof powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and\\nnot to use either of them but upon urgent occasions.\\n\\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view\\nof my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them\\nprovisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for\\nmany days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards\\u2014for about eight days\\u2019\\ntime; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them\\nabout a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should\\nknow them again when they came back, at a distance, before they came on\\nshore. They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at\\nfull, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact\\nreckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it\\nagain; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be\\nsure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my\\naccount, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.\\n\\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange\\nand unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps,\\nbeen heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,\\nwhen my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, \\u201cMaster,\\nmaster, they are come, they are come!\\u201d I jumped up, and regardless of\\ndanger I went, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little\\ngrove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick\\nwood; I say, regardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not\\nmy custom to do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea,\\nI presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing\\nin for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and\\nthe wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed,\\npresently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay\\non, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called\\nFriday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we\\nlooked for, and that we might not know yet whether they were friends or\\nenemies. In the next place I went in to fetch my perspective glass to\\nsee what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I\\nclimbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was\\napprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer without being\\ndiscovered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my eye plainly\\ndiscovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half\\ndistance from me, SSE., but not above a league and a half from the\\nshore. By my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and\\nthe boat appeared to be an English long-boat.\\n\\nI cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a\\nship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own\\ncountrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;\\nbut yet I had some secret doubts hung about me\\u2014I cannot tell from\\nwhence they came\\u2014bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it\\noccurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in\\nthat part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of\\nthe world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had been\\nno storms to drive them in there in distress; and that if they were\\nreally English it was most probable that they were here upon no good\\ndesign; and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the\\nhands of thieves and murderers.\\n\\nLet no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which\\nsometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of\\nits being real. That such hints and notices are given us I believe few\\nthat have made any observation of things can deny; that they are\\ncertain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits,\\nwe cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of\\ndanger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent\\n(whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question),\\nand that they are given for our good?\\n\\nThe present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this\\nreasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,\\ncome it from whence it will, I had been done inevitably, and in a far\\nworse condition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept\\nmyself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as\\nif they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of\\nlanding; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not\\nsee the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their\\nboat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was\\nvery happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my\\ndoor, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and\\nperhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore I was\\nfully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two\\nI thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven\\nmen, whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought,\\nbound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,\\nthey took those three out of the boat as prisoners: one of the three I\\ncould perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty,\\naffliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other two,\\nI could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared\\nconcerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was\\nperfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it\\nshould be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could, \\u201cO\\nmaster! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans.\\u201d\\n\\u201cWhy, Friday,\\u201d says I, \\u201cdo you think they are going to eat them, then?\\u201d\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d says Friday, \\u201cthey will eat them.\\u201d \\u201cNo no,\\u201d says I, \\u201cFriday; I\\nam afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure they will\\nnot eat them.\\u201d\\n\\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but\\nstood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment\\nwhen the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the\\nvillains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it,\\nor sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall\\nevery moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in\\nmy veins. I wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that\\nhad gone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered\\nwithin shot of them, that I might have secured the three men, for I saw\\nno firearms they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another\\nway. After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the\\ninsolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the\\nisland, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the three\\nother men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down\\nall three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in\\ndespair. This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore,\\nand began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly\\nI looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged\\nin the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As I\\nknew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the\\nprovidential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and\\ntide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported; so\\nthese three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance\\nand supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and\\nreally they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that they\\nthought themselves lost and their case desperate. So little do we see\\nbefore us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully\\nupon the great Maker of the world, that He does not leave His creatures\\nso absolutely destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have\\nalways something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer\\ndeliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their\\ndeliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their\\ndestruction.\\n\\nIt was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and while\\nthey rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had\\ncarelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed\\nconsiderably away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in\\nthe boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much\\nbrandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than\\nthe other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it,\\nhallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about: upon which they\\nall soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch\\nher, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft\\noozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like true\\nseamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to\\nforethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the\\ncountry again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling\\nthem off from the boat, \\u201cWhy, let her alone, Jack, can\\u2019t you? she\\u2019ll\\nfloat next tide;\\u201d by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of\\nwhat countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not\\nonce daring to stir out of my castle any farther than to my place of\\nobservation near the top of the hill: and very glad I was to think how\\nwell it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the\\nboat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might\\nbe at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse,\\nif they had any. In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle as\\nbefore, though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind\\nof enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an\\nexcellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took\\nmyself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure,\\nindeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with\\nthe great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols\\nin my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.\\n\\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it\\nwas dark; but about two o\\u2019clock, being the heat of the day, I found\\nthat they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought,\\nlaid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for\\ntheir condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the\\nshelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as\\nI thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to\\ndiscover myself to them, and learn something of their condition;\\nimmediately I marched as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind\\nme, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring a\\nspectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I\\ncould, and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in\\nSpanish, \\u201cWhat are ye, gentlemen?\\u201d They started up at the noise, but\\nwere ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure\\nthat I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them\\njust going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.\\n\\u201cGentlemen,\\u201d said I, \\u201cdo not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have a\\nfriend near when you did not expect it.\\u201d \\u201cHe must be sent directly from\\nheaven then,\\u201d said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his\\nhat at the same time to me; \\u201cfor our condition is past the help of\\nman.\\u201d \\u201cAll help is from heaven, sir,\\u201d said I, \\u201cbut can you put a\\nstranger in the way to help you? for you seem to be in some great\\ndistress. I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make\\napplication to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up\\nhis sword to kill you.\\u201d\\n\\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking\\nlike one astonished, returned, \\u201cAm I talking to God or man? Is it a\\nreal man or an angel?\\u201d \\u201cBe in no fear about that, sir,\\u201d said I; \\u201cif God\\nhad sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed,\\nand armed after another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your\\nfears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I\\nhave one servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can\\nwe serve you? What is your case?\\u201d \\u201cOur case, sir,\\u201d said he, \\u201cis too\\nlong to tell you while our murderers are so near us; but, in short,\\nsir, I was commander of that ship\\u2014my men have mutinied against me; they\\nhave been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set\\nme on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me\\u2014one my\\nmate, the other a passenger\\u2014where we expected to perish, believing the\\nplace to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.\\u201d \\u201cWhere\\nare these brutes, your enemies?\\u201d said I; \\u201cdo you know where they are\\ngone?\\u201d \\u201cThere they lie, sir,\\u201d said he, pointing to a thicket of trees;\\n\\u201cmy heart trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak; if\\nthey have, they will certainly murder us all.\\u201d \\u201cHave they any\\nfirearms?\\u201d said I. He answered, \\u201cThey had only two pieces, one of which\\nthey left in the boat.\\u201d \\u201cWell, then,\\u201d said I, \\u201cleave the rest to me; I\\nsee they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but\\nshall we rather take them prisoners?\\u201d He told me there were two\\ndesperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy\\nto; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to\\ntheir duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at\\nthat distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything\\nI would direct. \\u201cWell,\\u201d says I, \\u201clet us retreat out of their view or\\nhearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further.\\u201d So they\\nwillingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.\\n\\n\\u201cLook you, sir,\\u201d said I, \\u201cif I venture upon your deliverance, are you\\nwilling to make two conditions with me?\\u201d He anticipated my proposals by\\ntelling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly\\ndirected and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not\\nrecovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world\\nsoever I would send him; and the two other men said the same. \\u201cWell,\\u201d\\nsays I, \\u201cmy conditions are but two; first, that while you stay in this\\nisland with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I\\nput arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to\\nme, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the\\nmeantime be governed by my orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may\\nbe recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free.\\u201d\\n\\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could\\ndevise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and\\nbesides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions\\nas long as he lived. \\u201cWell, then,\\u201d said I, \\u201chere are three muskets for\\nyou, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be\\ndone.\\u201d He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,\\nbut offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was very\\nhard venturing anything; but the best method I could think of was to\\nfire on them at once as they lay, and if any were not killed at the\\nfirst volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it\\nwholly upon God\\u2019s providence to direct the shot. He said, very\\nmodestly, that he was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that\\nthose two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all\\nthe mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still,\\nfor they would go on board and bring the whole ship\\u2019s company, and\\ndestroy us all. \\u201cWell, then,\\u201d says I, \\u201cnecessity legitimates my advice,\\nfor it is the only way to save our lives.\\u201d However, seeing him still\\ncautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and\\nmanage as they found convenient.\\n\\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon\\nafter we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them\\nwere the heads of the mutiny? He said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWell, then,\\u201d said I, \\u201cyou\\nmay let them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on\\npurpose to save themselves. Now,\\u201d says I, \\u201cif the rest escape you, it\\nis your fault.\\u201d Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him\\nin his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him,\\nwith each a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going\\nfirst made some noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned\\nabout, and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but was too late\\nthen, for the moment he cried out they fired\\u2014I mean the two men, the\\ncaptain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their\\nshot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and\\nthe other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his\\nfeet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain\\nstepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should\\ncall upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him\\ndown with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there\\nwere three more in the company, and one of them was slightly wounded.\\nBy this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it\\nwas in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them he\\nwould spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their\\nabhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to\\nbe faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying\\nher back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the\\nprotestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was\\nwilling to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not\\nagainst, only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while\\nthey were on the island.\\n\\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain\\u2019s mate to the boat\\nwith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which\\nthey did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for\\nthem) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and\\nseeing the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror,\\nthey submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.\\n\\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one\\nanother\\u2019s circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history,\\nwhich he heard with an attention even to amazement\\u2014and particularly at\\nthe wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and\\nammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,\\nit affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself,\\nand how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his\\nlife, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.\\nAfter this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men\\ninto my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the\\ntop of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,\\nand showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long\\ninhabiting that place.\\n\\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above\\nall, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had\\nconcealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now\\nplanted nearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in\\nEngland, was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in\\nany part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little\\nwinding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my\\nresidence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,\\nwhither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too\\nanother time; but at present our business was to consider how to\\nrecover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was\\nperfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were still\\nsix-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed\\nconspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,\\nwould be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on,\\nknowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows\\nas soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and\\nthat, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a\\nnumber as we were.\\n\\nI mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very\\nrational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on\\nspeedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their\\nsurprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon\\nthis, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship\\u2019s\\ncrew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat,\\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and\\nthat then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us:\\nthis he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing\\nwe had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that\\nthey might not carry her off, and taking everything out of her, leave\\nher so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly, we went on\\nboard, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever\\nelse we found there\\u2014which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a\\nfew biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a\\npiece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very\\nwelcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none\\nleft for many years.\\n\\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail,\\nand rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great\\nhole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us,\\nyet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my\\nthoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was,\\nthat if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to\\nmake her again fit to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon\\nour friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my\\nthoughts.\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1852,\n            'f': \"1852\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 17,\n            'f': \"17\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 17,\n            'f': \"17\",\n        },\n\". THE SHIP RECOVERED\\n\\n\\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\\nstrength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would\\nnot float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in\\nher bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what\\nwe should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her\\nensign as a signal for the boat to come on board\\u2014but no boat stirred;\\nand they fired several times, making other signals for the boat. At\\nlast, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they\\nfound the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses,\\nhoist another boat out and row towards the shore; and we found, as they\\napproached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they\\nhad firearms with them.\\n\\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view\\nof them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because\\nthe tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they\\nrowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the other had\\nlanded, and where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full\\nview of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all\\nthe men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest\\nfellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest,\\nbeing over-powered and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who\\nit seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were\\nas outrageous as any of the ship\\u2019s crew, and were no doubt made\\ndesperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was\\nthat they would be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him\\nthat men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that\\nseeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which\\nwe were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,\\nwhether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him\\nwhat he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a\\ndeliverance were not worth venturing for? \\u201cAnd where, sir,\\u201d said I, \\u201cis\\nyour belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,\\nwhich elevated you a little while ago? For my part,\\u201d said I, \\u201cthere\\nseems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is\\nthat?\\u201d say he. \\u201cWhy,\\u201d said I, \\u201cit is, that as you say there are three\\nor four honest fellows among them which should be spared, had they been\\nall of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God\\u2019s\\nprovidence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for\\ndepend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die\\nor live as they behave to us.\\u201d As I spoke this with a raised voice and\\ncheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set\\nvigorously to our business.\\n\\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boat\\u2019s coming from the ship,\\nconsidered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured\\nthem effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured\\nthan ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men,\\nto my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being\\nheard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they\\ncould have delivered themselves. Here they left them bound, but gave\\nthem provisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to\\ngive them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted\\ntheir escape they should be put to death without mercy. They promised\\nfaithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very\\nthankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light\\nleft them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for\\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over\\nthem at the entrance.\\n\\nThe other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,\\nindeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other\\ntwo were taken into my service, upon the captain\\u2019s recommendation, and\\nupon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and\\nthe three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt\\nwe should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,\\nconsidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest\\nmen among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other\\nboat lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore,\\nhauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was\\nafraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance\\nfrom the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should\\nnot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they\\ndid, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were\\nunder a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was\\nin her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while\\nupon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all\\ntheir might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all\\nwas to no purpose. Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a\\nvolley of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made\\nthe woods ring. But it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure,\\ncould not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well\\nenough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished at\\nthe surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved\\nto go all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men\\nwere all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they\\nimmediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.\\n\\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this,\\nbelieving they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving\\ntheir comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,\\nwhich he was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as\\nmuch frightened the other way.\\n\\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them\\nall coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,\\nwhich it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in\\nthe boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to\\nlook for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now\\nwe were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore\\nwould be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they\\nwould row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to\\nweigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.\\nHowever we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things\\nmight present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained\\nin the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to\\nan anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at\\nthem in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together,\\nmarching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation\\nlay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us.\\nWe should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us, so\\nthat we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther\\noff, that we might come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of\\nthe hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods,\\nwhich lay towards the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest,\\nthey shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it\\nseems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they\\nsat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought fit to\\nhave gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had\\ndone the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger\\nto venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the danger\\nwas they had to fear.\\n\\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of\\ntheirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\\nendeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\\nthem just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and\\nthey would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.\\nI liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough\\nto come up to them before they could load their pieces again. But this\\nevent did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute\\nwhat course to take. At length I told them there would be nothing done,\\nin my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the\\nboat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore,\\nand so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on\\nshore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for their\\nremoving; and were very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw\\nthem all start up and march down towards the sea; it seems they had\\nsuch dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place that they\\nresolved to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for\\nlost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.\\n\\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be\\nas it really was that they had given over their search, and were going\\nback again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was\\nready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a\\nstratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a\\ntittle. I ordered Friday and the captain\\u2019s mate to go over the little\\ncreek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when\\nFriday was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round,\\nat about half a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they\\ncould, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as\\never they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again;\\nand then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the\\nothers hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the\\nwoods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I\\ndirected them.\\n\\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed;\\nand they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore\\nwestward, towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the\\ncreek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and called\\nfor the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When\\nthey had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a\\ngood way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land,\\nthey took one of the three men out of her, to go along with them, and\\nleft only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little\\ntree on the shore. This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving\\nFriday and the captain\\u2019s mate to their business, I took the rest with\\nme; and, crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two\\nmen before they were aware\\u2014one of them lying on the shore, and the\\nother being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and\\nwaking, and going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in\\nupon him, and knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat\\nto yield, or he was a dead man. They needed very few arguments to\\npersuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him and his\\ncomrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who\\nwere not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore\\nwas easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very\\nsincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain\\u2019s mate so\\nwell managed their business with the rest that they drew them, by\\nhallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to\\nanother, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where\\nthey were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it\\nwas dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the\\ntime they came back to us.\\n\\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours\\nafter Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and\\nwe could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up,\\ncalling to those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer,\\nand complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any\\nfaster: which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to\\nthe boat: but it is impossible to express their confusion when they\\nfound the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their\\ntwo men gone. We could hear them call one to another in a most\\nlamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted\\nisland; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all\\nbe murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they\\nshould be all carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and\\ncalled their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no\\nanswer. After some time we could see them, by the little light there\\nwas, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes\\nthey would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then come\\nashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.\\nMy men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once\\nin the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to\\nspare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was\\nunwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing the others\\nwere very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not\\nseparate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade\\nnearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands\\nand feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be\\ndiscovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they\\noffered to fire.\\n\\nThey had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the\\nprincipal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most\\ndejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them,\\nwith two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this\\nprincipal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have\\npatience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only\\nheard his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and\\nFriday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was\\nkilled upon the spot: the next man was shot in the body, and fell just\\nby him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third\\nran for it. At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my\\nwhole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo;\\nFriday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the\\nthree prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon\\nthem, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I\\nmade the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call\\nthem by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps\\nmight reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for\\nindeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be\\nvery willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one\\nof them, \\u201cTom Smith! Tom Smith!\\u201d Tom Smith answered immediately, \\u201cIs\\nthat Robinson?\\u201d for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered,\\n\\u201cAy, ay; for God\\u2019s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or\\nyou are all dead men this moment.\\u201d \\u201cWho must we yield to? Where are\\nthey?\\u201d says Smith again. \\u201cHere they are,\\u201d says he; \\u201chere\\u2019s our captain\\nand fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours; the\\nboatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if\\nyou do not yield you are all lost.\\u201d \\u201cWill they give us quarter, then?\\u201d\\nsays Tom Smith, \\u201cand we will yield.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll go and ask, if you promise\\nto yield,\\u201d said Robinson: so he asked the captain, and the captain\\nhimself then calls out, \\u201cYou, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down\\nyour arms immediately and submit, you shall have your lives, all but\\nWill Atkins.\\u201d\\n\\nUpon this Will Atkins cried out, \\u201cFor God\\u2019s sake, captain, give me\\nquarter; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I:\\u201d which, by\\nthe way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man\\nthat laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him\\nbarbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language.\\nHowever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,\\nand trust to the governor\\u2019s mercy: by which he meant me, for they all\\ncalled me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged\\ntheir lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two\\nmore, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,\\nwith those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them,\\nand upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight\\nfor reasons of state.\\n\\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship:\\nand as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\\nexpostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him,\\nand upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it\\nmust bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the\\ngallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their\\nlives. As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the\\ncommander\\u2019s of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore\\nin a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct\\nthem that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman;\\nthat he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given\\nthem all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be\\ndealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was\\ncommanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he\\nwould be hanged in the morning.\\n\\nThough this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\\neffect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with\\nthe governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God\\u2019s\\nsake, that they might not be sent to England.\\n\\nIt now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and\\nthat it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be\\nhearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from\\nthem, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and\\ncalled the captain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the\\nmen was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, \\u201cCaptain, the\\ncommander calls for you;\\u201d and presently the captain replied, \\u201cTell his\\nexcellency I am just coming.\\u201d This more perfectly amazed them, and they\\nall believed that the commander was just by, with his fifty men. Upon\\nthe captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship,\\nwhich he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution\\nthe next morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be\\nsecure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he\\nshould go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send\\nthem pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was committed to\\nFriday and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They\\nconveyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal\\nplace, especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered to my\\nbower, as I called it, of which I have given a full description: and as\\nit was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,\\nconsidering they were upon their behaviour.\\n\\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a\\nparley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he\\nthought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the\\nship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they\\nwere brought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter\\nfor their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to\\nEngland they would all be hanged in chains; but that if they would join\\nin so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the\\ngovernor\\u2019s engagement for their pardon.\\n\\nAny one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men\\nin their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and\\npromised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to\\nhim to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and\\nwould go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a\\nfather to them as long as they lived. \\u201cWell,\\u201d says the captain, \\u201cI must\\ngo and tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring\\nhim to consent to it.\\u201d So he brought me an account of the temper he\\nfound them in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.\\nHowever, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back\\nagain and choose out those five, and tell them, that they might see he\\ndid not want men, that he would take out those five to be his\\nassistants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and the\\nthree that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for\\nthe fidelity of those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the\\nexecution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the\\nshore. This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in\\nearnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it\\nwas now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to\\npersuade the other five to do their duty.\\n\\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the\\ncaptain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the\\nfirst gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had\\ngiven their liberty, and trusted them with arms; third, the other two\\nthat I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, but on the captain\\u2019s\\nmotion had now released; fourth, these five released at last; so that\\nthere were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave\\nfor hostages.\\n\\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\\nboard the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was\\nproper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was\\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with\\nvictuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but\\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries;\\nand I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where\\nFriday was to take them.\\n\\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who\\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them;\\nand that it was the governor\\u2019s pleasure they should not stir anywhere\\nbut by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the\\ncastle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see\\nme as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the\\ngovernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\\n\\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two\\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger\\ncaptain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five\\nmore, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well,\\nfor they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came\\nwithin call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they\\nhad brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time\\nbefore they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till\\nthey came to the ship\\u2019s side; when the captain and the mate entering\\nfirst with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and\\ncarpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully\\nseconded by their men; they secured all the rest that were upon the\\nmain and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them\\ndown that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering at\\nthe forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle\\nwhich went down into the cook-room, making three men they found there\\nprisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain\\nordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where\\nthe new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and\\nwith two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands; and when the\\nmate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men\\nfired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which\\nbroke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The\\nmate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded\\nas he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the head,\\nthe bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his\\nears, so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded,\\nand the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.\\n\\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to\\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of\\nhis success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having\\nsat watching upon the shore for it till near two o\\u2019clock in the\\nmorning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it\\nhaving been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I\\nwas surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I\\nheard a man call me by the name of \\u201cGovernor! Governor!\\u201d and presently\\nI knew the captain\\u2019s voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill,\\nthere he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms,\\n\\u201cMy dear friend and deliverer,\\u201d says he, \\u201cthere\\u2019s your ship; for she is\\nall yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.\\u201d I cast my eyes\\nto the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of\\nthe shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters\\nof her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just\\nagainst the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the\\ncaptain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first\\nlanded my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to\\nsink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly\\nput into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to\\ncarry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was\\nnot able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms I\\nheld fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived\\nthe surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and\\ngave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.\\nAfter I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought\\nme to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to\\nhim. All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only\\nnot under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender\\nthings to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood\\nof joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last\\nit broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my\\nspeech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we\\nrejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven\\nto deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of\\nwonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a\\nsecret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the\\neye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the\\nworld, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not\\nto lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could\\nforbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided\\nfor me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from\\nwhom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.\\n\\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this,\\nhe called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore\\nthat were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had\\nbeen one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had\\nbeen to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of\\nbottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira\\nwine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good\\ntobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship\\u2019s beef, and six pieces of pork,\\nwith a bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also\\nbrought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and\\ntwo bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things. But besides\\nthese, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me\\nsix new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one\\npair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit\\nof clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word,\\nhe clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable\\npresent, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances, but never\\nwas anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and\\nuneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first.\\n\\nAfter these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were\\nbrought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be\\ndone with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we\\nmight venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom\\nhe knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the\\ncaptain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging\\nthem, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as\\nmalefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English\\ncolony he could come to; and I found that the captain himself was very\\nanxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would\\nundertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request\\nthat he should leave them upon the island. \\u201cI should be very glad of\\nthat,\\u201d says the captain, \\u201cwith all my heart.\\u201d \\u201cWell,\\u201d says I, \\u201cI will\\nsend for them up and talk with them for you.\\u201d So I caused Friday and\\nthe two hostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having\\nperformed their promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and\\nbring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep\\nthem there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my\\nnew habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the\\ncaptain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I told\\nthem I had got a full account of their villainous behaviour to the\\ncaptain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to\\ncommit further robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in\\ntheir own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had\\ndug for others. I let them know that by my direction the ship had been\\nseized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see by-and-by that\\ntheir new captain had received the reward of his villainy, and that\\nthey would see him hanging at the yard-arm; that, as to them, I wanted\\nto know what they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates\\ntaken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had\\nauthority so to do.\\n\\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to\\nsay but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their\\nlives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not\\nwhat mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the\\nisland with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to\\nEngland; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England\\nother than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running\\naway with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know,\\nwould be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them,\\nunless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they\\ndesired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some\\ninclination to give them their lives, if they thought they could shift\\non shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much\\nrather venture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged.\\nSo I left it on that issue.\\n\\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he\\ndurst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with the\\ncaptain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that\\nseeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my\\nword; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set\\nthem at liberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it he might\\ntake them again if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very\\nthankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire\\ninto the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave them\\nsome firearms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should\\nlive very well if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board\\nthe ship; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my\\nthings, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all\\nright in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering\\nhim, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be\\nhanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.\\n\\nWhen the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\\nand entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.\\nI told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain\\nhad carried them away they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the\\nnew captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had\\nnothing less to expect.\\n\\nWhen they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them\\nI would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into\\nthe way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole\\nhistory of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my\\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\\ngrapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I\\ntold them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be\\nexpected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them\\nin common with themselves. Here it may be noted that the captain, who\\nhad ink on board, was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of\\nmaking ink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done\\nthings much more difficult.\\n\\nI left them my firearms\\u2014viz. five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and\\nthree swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after\\nthe first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a\\ndescription of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and\\nfatten them, and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them\\nevery part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the\\ncaptain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some\\ngarden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of. Also, I\\ngave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and\\nbade them be sure to sow and increase them.\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1973,\n            'f': \"1973\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 18,\n            'f': \"18\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 18,\n            'f': \"18\",\n        },\n\". RETURN TO ENGLAND\\n\\n\\nHaving done all this I left them the next day, and went on board the\\nship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.\\nThe next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship\\u2019s\\nside, and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three,\\nbegged to be taken into the ship for God\\u2019s sake, for they should be\\nmurdered, and begged the captain to take them on board, though he\\nhanged them immediately. Upon this the captain pretended to have no\\npower without me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn\\npromises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time\\nafter, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest\\nand quiet fellows.\\n\\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,\\nwith the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my\\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\\ntook, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling\\nthem that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I\\nwould not forget them.\\n\\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the\\ngreat goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots;\\nalso, I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had\\nlain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and\\ncould hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and\\nhandled, as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.\\nAnd thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the\\nship\\u2019s account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it\\neight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered\\nfrom this second captivity the same day of the month that I first made\\nmy escape in the long-boat from among the Moors of Sallee. In this\\nvessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, in\\nthe year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent.\\n\\nWhen I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as\\nif I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful steward,\\nwhom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great\\nmisfortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very\\nlow in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring\\nher I would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for\\nher former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little\\nstock would afford; which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do\\nbut little for her; but I assured her I would never forget her former\\nkindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her,\\nas shall be observed in its proper place. I went down afterwards into\\nYorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family\\nextinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of\\none of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,\\nthere had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I found\\nnothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little money I had would\\nnot do much for me as to settling in the world.\\n\\nI met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and\\nthis was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,\\nand by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very\\nhandsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives\\nof the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other\\nmerchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome\\ncompliment upon the subject, and a present of almost \\u00a3200 sterling.\\n\\nBut after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,\\nand how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I\\nresolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some\\ninformation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what\\nwas become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years\\npast given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,\\nwhere I arrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very\\nhonestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant\\nupon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and\\nto my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship\\nwho first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown\\nold, and had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far\\nfrom a young man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.\\nThe old man did not know me, and indeed I hardly knew him. But I soon\\nbrought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his\\nremembrance, when I told him who I was.\\n\\nAfter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I\\ninquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old\\nman told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but\\nthat he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living,\\nbut the trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my\\npart were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very\\ngood account of the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the\\ngeneral belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given\\nin the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the\\nprocurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to\\nclaim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St.\\nAugustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the\\nconversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I\\nappeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be\\nrestored; only that the improvement, or annual production, being\\ndistributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured\\nme that the steward of the king\\u2019s revenue from lands, and the\\nprovidore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along\\nthat the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a\\nfaithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my\\nmoiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had\\nbrought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth\\nlooking after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any\\nobstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told me he\\ncould not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but\\nthis he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the\\nenjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he\\nhad heard that the king\\u2019s third of my part, which was, it seems,\\ngranted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to\\nabove two hundred moidores a year: that as to my being restored to a\\nquiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my\\npartner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also\\nenrolled in the register of the country; also he told me that the\\nsurvivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very\\nwealthy; and he believed I would not only have their assistance for\\nputting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of\\nmoney in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm\\nwhile their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as\\nabove; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.\\n\\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and\\ninquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees\\nshould thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my\\nwill, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.\\n\\nHe told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being\\ndead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should\\ncome of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with\\na thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put\\nin his claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or\\nalive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the\\ningenio (so they call the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was\\nnow at the Brazils, orders to do it. \\u201cBut,\\u201d says the old man, \\u201cI have\\none piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable\\nto you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the\\nworld believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account\\nwith me, in your name, for the first six or eight years\\u2019 profits, which\\nI received. There being at that time great disbursements for increasing\\nthe works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to\\nnear so much as afterwards it produced; however,\\u201d says the old man, \\u201cI\\nshall give you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I\\nhave disposed of it.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter a few days\\u2019 further conference with this ancient friend, he\\nbrought me an account of the first six years\\u2019 income of my plantation,\\nsigned by my partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered\\nin goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum,\\nmolasses, &c., which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by\\nthis account, that every year the income considerably increased; but,\\nas above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small:\\nhowever, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred\\nand seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen\\ndouble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been\\nshipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having\\nthe place. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and\\nhow he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses,\\nand buy him a share in a new ship. \\u201cHowever, my old friend,\\u201d says he,\\n\\u201cyou shall not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son\\nreturns you shall be fully satisfied.\\u201d Upon this he pulls out an old\\npouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold;\\nand giving the writings of his title to the ship, which his son was\\ngone to the Brazils in, of which he was quarter-part owner, and his son\\nanother, he puts them both into my hands for security of the rest.\\n\\nI was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to\\nbe able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he\\nhad taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all\\noccasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I\\ncould hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I\\nasked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at\\nthat time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he could not\\nsay but it might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money,\\nand I might want it more than he.\\n\\nEverything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly\\nrefrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the\\nmoidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:\\nthen I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of\\nthe plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I\\nafterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his\\nson\\u2019s ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the\\nmoney, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but\\ncame to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a\\npenny more from him.\\n\\nWhen this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a\\nmethod to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought to go\\nover to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I\\ndid not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to\\nappropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river\\nof Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in\\na public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was\\nalive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the\\nplanting the said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by\\na notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a\\nletter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place;\\nand then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the\\nreturn.\\n\\nNever was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this\\nprocuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet\\nfrom the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I\\nwent to sea, in which were the following, particular letters and papers\\nenclosed:\\u2014\\n\\nFirst, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or\\nplantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old\\nPortugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one\\nthousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.\\n\\nSecondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the\\neffects in their hands, before the government claimed the\\nadministration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which\\nthey called civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the\\nplantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and\\nforty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and forty\\nmoidores.\\n\\nThirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine\\u2019s account, who had\\nreceived the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to\\naccount for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly\\ndeclared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed,\\nwhich he acknowledged to my account: as to the king\\u2019s part, that\\nrefunded nothing.\\n\\nThere was a letter of my partner\\u2019s, congratulating me very\\naffectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate\\nwas improved, and what it produced a year; with the particulars of the\\nnumber of squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many\\nslaves there were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for\\nblessings, told me he had said so many _Ave Marias_ to thank the\\nBlessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come\\nover and take possession of my own, and in the meantime to give him\\norders to whom he should deliver my effects if I did not come myself;\\nconcluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his\\nfamily; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards\\u2019 skins, which he\\nhad, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had\\nsent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He\\nsent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces\\nof gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my\\ntwo merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of\\nsugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole\\naccount in gold.\\n\\nI might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better\\nthan the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my\\nvery heart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships\\ncome all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my\\ngoods: and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came\\nto my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the\\nold man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of\\njoy had overset nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that I\\ncontinued very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent\\nfor, and something of the real cause of my illness being known, he\\nordered me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well:\\nbut I verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that\\nmanner to the spirits, I should have died.\\n\\nI was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds\\nsterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the\\nBrazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of\\nlands in England: and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce\\nknew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of\\nit. The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my\\ngood old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress,\\nkind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him\\nall that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the providence of\\nHeaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now\\nlay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first\\nreturned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent\\nfor a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge\\nfrom the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged\\nhe owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which I\\ncaused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of\\nthe annual profits of my plantation: and appointing my partner to\\naccount with him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in\\nmy name; and by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred\\nmoidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty\\nmoidores a year to his son after him, for his life: and thus I requited\\nmy old man.\\n\\nI had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do\\nwith the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and,\\nindeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life\\nin the island where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing\\nbut what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my\\nbusiness was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to hide my money\\nin, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew\\nmouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on the\\ncontrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old\\npatron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I\\nhad. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me\\nthither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I\\nhad settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind\\nme. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was\\nhonest, and would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but\\npoor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, I\\nhad no way but to go back to England myself and take my effects with\\nme.\\n\\nIt was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and,\\ntherefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his\\nsatisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of\\nthe poor widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she,\\nwhile it was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. So, the\\nfirst thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his\\ncorrespondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her\\nout, and carry her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk\\nwith her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if\\nI lived, have a further supply: at the same time I sent my two sisters\\nin the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want,\\nyet not in very good circumstances; one having been married and left a\\nwidow; and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should\\nbe. But among all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch\\nupon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go\\naway to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly\\nperplexed me.\\n\\nI had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled myself\\nthere, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but I had some\\nlittle scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me\\nback. However, it was not religion that kept me from going there for\\nthe present; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the\\nreligion of the country all the while I was among them, so neither did\\nI yet; only that, now and then, having of late thought more of it than\\nformerly, when I began to think of living and dying among them, I began\\nto regret having professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be\\nthe best religion to die with.\\n\\nBut, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from\\ngoing to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave\\nmy effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if\\nI arrived, I concluded that I should make some acquaintance, or find\\nsome relations, that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I\\nprepared to go to England with all my wealth.\\n\\nIn order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet\\nbeing just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just\\nand faithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the\\nPrior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just\\ndealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores\\nwhich were undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred\\nto the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the\\nprior should direct; desiring the good padre\\u2019s prayers for me, and the\\nlike. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the\\nacknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for\\nsending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of\\nit. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the\\nimproving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of\\nthe works; giving him instructions for his future government of my\\npart, according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I\\ndesired him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from\\nme more particularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to\\ncome to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.\\nTo this I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his\\nwife and two daughters, for such the captain\\u2019s son informed me he had;\\nwith two pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in\\nLisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good\\nvalue.\\n\\nHaving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my\\neffects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way\\nto go to England: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I\\nhad a strange aversion to go to England by the sea at that time, and\\nyet I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me\\nso much, that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet\\nI altered my mind, and that not once but two or three times.\\n\\nIt is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of\\nthe reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own\\nthoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled\\nout to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other,\\nhaving put my things on board one of them, and in the other having\\nagreed with the captain; I say two of these ships miscarried. One was\\ntaken by the Algerines, and the other was lost on the Start, near\\nTorbay, and all the people drowned except three; so that in either of\\nthose vessels I had been made miserable.\\n\\nHaving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I\\ncommunicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but\\neither to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to\\nRochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to\\nParis, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all\\nthe way by land through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed\\nagainst my going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I\\nresolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste,\\nand did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to\\nmake it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son\\nof a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which\\nwe picked up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese\\ngentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that in all there were six\\nof us and five servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese,\\ncontenting themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge;\\nand as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant,\\nbesides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of\\nsupplying the place of a servant on the road.\\n\\nIn this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well\\nmounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the\\nhonour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as\\nbecause I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole\\njourney.\\n\\nAs I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble\\nyou now with none of my land journals; but some adventures that\\nhappened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.\\n\\nWhen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were\\nwilling to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth\\nobserving; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened\\naway, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we\\ncame to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the\\nway, with an account that so much snow was falling on the French side\\nof the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to\\nPampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.\\n\\nWhen we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me,\\nthat had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I\\ncould scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable; nor,\\nindeed, was it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before\\nout of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm but very hot,\\nand immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very\\nkeen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing\\nand perishing of our fingers and toes.\\n\\nPoor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered\\nwith snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt\\nbefore in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it\\ncontinued snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people\\nsaid winter was come before its time; and the roads, which were\\ndifficult before, were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow\\nlay in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard\\nfrozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there was no going\\nwithout being in danger of being buried alive every step. We stayed no\\nless than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on,\\nand no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter\\nall over Europe that had been known in the memory of man) I proposed\\nthat we should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for\\nBordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was considering\\nthis, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on\\nthe French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out\\na guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had\\nbrought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much\\nincommoded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any quantity,\\nthey said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We\\nsent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the\\nsame way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed\\nsufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in\\nthese great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at\\nthe foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the\\nground being covered with snow. We told him we were well enough\\nprepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a\\nkind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger\\nfrom, especially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied us\\nthat there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go; so\\nwe readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen\\nwith their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had\\nattempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.\\n\\nAccordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of\\nNovember; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he\\ncame directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,\\nabout twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the\\nplain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the\\ncountry was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning\\nto his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is\\ntrue the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many\\ntours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we\\ninsensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much\\nencumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant\\nand fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and\\nflourishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough way to\\npass still.\\n\\nWe were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day\\nand a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we\\nshould soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend\\nevery day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon\\nour guide, we went on.\\n\\nIt was about two hours before night when, our guide being something\\nbefore us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves,\\nand after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two\\nof the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he\\nwould have been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them\\nfastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such\\nviolence, that he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his\\npistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday\\nbeing next me, I bade him ride up and see what was the matter. As soon\\nas Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the\\nother, \\u201cO master! O master!\\u201d but like a bold fellow, rode directly up\\nto the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that\\nattacked him.\\n\\nIt was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having\\nbeen used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him,\\nbut went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would\\nhave fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the\\nwolf or endangered shooting the man.\\n\\nBut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed,\\nit alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday\\u2019s pistol, we\\nheard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,\\nredoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had\\nbeen a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few\\nas that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed\\nthis wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him\\nimmediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily\\nfastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his\\nteeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him\\ntwice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and\\nthough he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the\\ndisorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.\\n\\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday\\u2019s pistol we all\\nmended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very\\ndifficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as\\nwe came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly\\nwhat had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide,\\nthough we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had\\nkilled.\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 2086,\n            'f': \"2086\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 19,\n            'f': \"19\",\n        },\n\". FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR\\n\\n\\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising\\nmanner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave\\nus all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the\\ngreatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature,\\nand does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has\\ntwo particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions;\\nfirst, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually\\nattempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively\\nhungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being\\ncovered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle\\nwith you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give\\nhim the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step\\nout of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best\\nway is to look another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you\\nstop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an\\naffront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it were but a\\nbit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets\\nall other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have\\nsatisfaction in point of honour\\u2014that is his first quality: the next is,\\nif he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he\\nhas his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes\\nyou.\\n\\nMy man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him he\\nwas helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and\\nfrightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood;\\nand a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were\\nall a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was\\neasy to see joy and courage in the fellow\\u2019s countenance. \\u201cO! O! O!\\u201d\\nsays Friday, three times, pointing to him; \\u201cO master, you give me te\\nleave, me shakee te hand with him; me makee you good laugh.\\u201d\\n\\nI was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. \\u201cYou fool,\\u201d says I,\\n\\u201che will eat you up.\\u201d\\u2014\\u201cEatee me up! eatee me up!\\u201d says Friday, twice\\nover again; \\u201cme eatee him up; me makee you good laugh; you all stay\\nhere, me show you good laugh.\\u201d So down he sits, and gets off his boots\\nin a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes\\nthey wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his\\nhorse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.\\n\\nThe bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till\\nFriday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could\\nunderstand him. \\u201cHark ye, hark ye,\\u201d says Friday, \\u201cme speakee with you.\\u201d\\nWe followed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of\\nthe mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was\\nplain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here\\nand there. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up\\nwith him quickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and\\nhit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had\\nthrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday\\u2019s end, for the rogue\\nwas so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,\\nand show us some laugh as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the\\nblow, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very long\\nstrides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a\\nhorse to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his course as\\nif he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon\\nthe bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for bringing\\nthe bear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another\\nway; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,\\nand then ran away; and I called out, \\u201cYou dog! is this your making us\\nlaugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.\\u201d\\nHe heard me, and cried out, \\u201cNo shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you\\nget much laugh:\\u201d and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear\\u2019s\\none, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great\\noak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling\\nhis pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the\\nground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. The\\nbear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the first\\nthing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up\\nhe scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous\\nheavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could\\nnot for my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear get up\\nthe tree, we all rode near to him.\\n\\nWhen we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of\\na large branch, and the bear got about half-way to him. As soon as the\\nbear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, \\u201cHa!\\u201d\\nsays he to us, \\u201cnow you see me teachee the bear dance:\\u201d so he began\\njumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but\\nstood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get\\nback; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with\\nhim by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him\\nagain, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, \\u201cWhat, you\\ncome no farther? pray you come farther;\\u201d so he left jumping and shaking\\nthe tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come\\na little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped\\nagain. We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and\\ncalled to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he\\ncried out earnestly, \\u201cOh, pray! Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and\\nthen:\\u201d he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story,\\nFriday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had\\nlaughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do:\\nfor first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we\\nfound the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out\\nfar enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws\\nand feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and\\nwhat the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly:\\nfor seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be\\npersuaded to come any farther, \\u201cWell, well,\\u201d says Friday, \\u201cyou no come\\nfarther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;\\u201d and upon this he\\nwent out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and\\ngently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near\\nenough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it\\nup, and stood still. \\u201cWell,\\u201d said I to him, \\u201cFriday, what will you do\\nnow? Why don\\u2019t you shoot him?\\u201d \\u201cNo shoot,\\u201d says Friday, \\u201cno yet; me\\nshoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:\\u201d and, indeed,\\nso he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back from the\\nbough, where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him\\nevery step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree,\\nthen, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,\\ngrasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very\\nleisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot\\non the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of\\nhis piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about\\nto see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our\\nlooks, he began to laugh very loud. \\u201cSo we kill bear in my country,\\u201d\\nsays Friday. \\u201cSo you kill them?\\u201d says I; \\u201cwhy, you have no guns.\\u201d\\u2014\\u201cNo,\\u201d\\nsays he, \\u201cno gun, but shoot great much long arrow.\\u201d This was a good\\ndiversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very\\nmuch hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran\\nmuch in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the\\nshore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard\\nanything that filled me with so much horror.\\n\\nThese things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as\\nFriday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of\\nthis monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near\\nthree leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and\\nwent forward on our journey.\\n\\nThe ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and\\ndangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard\\nafterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed\\nby hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in\\nthe villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a great\\nmany of their sheep and horses, and some people too.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were\\nmore wolves in the country we should find them there; and this was a\\nsmall plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long, narrow\\ndefile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and\\nthen we should come to the village where we were to lodge.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the wood, and a\\nlittle after sunset when we came into the plain: we met with nothing in\\nthe first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which\\nwas not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the\\nroad, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of\\nsome prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were gone\\nout of sight in a few moments. Upon this, our guide, who, by the way,\\nwas but a fainthearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he\\nbelieved there were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and\\nour eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that\\nwood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as\\nwe came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The\\nfirst object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse\\nwhich the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we\\ncould not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had\\neaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at\\ntheir feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would have\\nlet fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found\\nwe were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware\\nof. We had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the\\nwolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and\\npresently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us,\\nall in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army\\ndrawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to\\nreceive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only\\nway; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have too much\\ninterval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the\\nothers, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second\\nvolley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that\\nthose that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees\\nagain, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed\\nwith a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this\\nmethod, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at\\npresent we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the\\nenemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with\\nthe fire. Four of them being shot in the head, dropped; several others\\nwere wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I\\nfound they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon,\\nremembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were\\nterrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as\\nloud as they could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for\\nupon our shout they began to retire and turn about. I then ordered a\\nsecond volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop,\\nand away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our\\npieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had\\nbut little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness,\\nwhen we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that\\nit was farther onward, the same way we were to go.\\n\\nThe night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it\\nworse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive\\nthat it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on\\na sudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one\\nbehind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded\\nwith them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way\\nforward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being\\nvery rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view\\nof the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the\\nfarther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming\\nnearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing\\njust at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we\\nheard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse,\\nwith a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or\\nseventeen wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advantage of\\nthem; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we\\ndoubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but\\nthey did.\\n\\nBut here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance\\nwhere the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and\\nof two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was\\nno doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just\\nby him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his\\nbody was eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what\\ncourse to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered\\nabout us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were\\nthree hundred of them. It happened, very much to our advantage, that at\\nthe entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some\\nlarge timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I\\nsuppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those\\ntrees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised\\nthem all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork,\\nto stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the\\ncentre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious\\ncharge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with\\na growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I\\nsaid, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey;\\nand this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their\\nseeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every\\nother man; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of\\nthe wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a\\ncontinual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on\\nthose before.\\n\\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they\\nstopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but\\na moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our\\npistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or\\neighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I\\nwas loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my\\nman Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest\\ndexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were\\nengaged\\u2014but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of\\npowder, I had him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it\\nbe a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get away, when\\nthe wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an\\nuncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were\\nupon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell;\\nor rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire; we\\ndespatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with\\nthe light, which the night\\u2014for it was now very near dark\\u2014made more\\nterrible that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our last\\npistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout;\\nupon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near\\ntwenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to\\ncutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the\\ncrying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so\\nthat they all fled and left us.\\n\\nWe had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it\\nbeen daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus\\ncleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.\\nWe heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went\\nseveral times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the\\nsnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In about an hour more we\\ncame to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible\\nfright and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and\\nsome bears had broken into the village, and put them in such terror\\nthat they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in\\nthe night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.\\n\\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much\\nwith the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we\\nwere obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we\\nfound a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no\\nwolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse,\\nthey told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest\\nat the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the\\nground; but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would\\nventure to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it\\nwas surprising we were not all devoured. When we told them how we\\nplaced ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us\\nexceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all\\ndestroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so\\nfurious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really\\nafraid of a gun; but being excessively hungry, and raging on that\\naccount, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of\\ndanger, and that if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by\\nthe stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great\\nodds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content\\nto have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not\\nhave taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their\\nbacks, as otherwise; and withal, they told us that at last, if we had\\nstood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to\\nhave devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having\\nour firearms in our hands, being so many in number. For my part, I was\\nnever so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three hundred\\ndevils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing\\nto shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it\\nwas, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I\\nthink I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was\\nsure to meet with a storm once a-week.\\n\\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through\\nFrance\\u2014nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with\\nmuch more advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and\\nwithout any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover\\nthe 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel\\nin.\\n\\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time\\nall my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which\\nI brought with me having been currently paid.\\n\\nMy principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who,\\nin gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much\\nnor care too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that\\nI was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I\\nwas very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted\\nintegrity of this good gentlewoman.\\n\\nAnd now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I\\nwrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having offered it to the two\\nmerchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they\\naccepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight\\nto a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.\\n\\nIn return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of\\nexchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the\\nestate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him\\n(the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son\\nfor his life, which I had promised them, and which the plantation was\\nto make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part of\\na life of fortune and adventure\\u2014a life of Providence\\u2019s chequer-work,\\nand of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like\\nof; beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of\\nit ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.\\n\\nAny one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I\\nwas past running any more hazards\\u2014and so, indeed, I had been, if other\\ncircumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had\\nno family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted\\nfresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet\\nI could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to\\nbe upon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong\\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards\\nwere in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me\\nfrom it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she\\nprevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two nephews,\\nthe children of one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having\\nsomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a\\nsettlement of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I\\nplaced with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a\\nsensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,\\nand sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as\\nold as I was, to further adventures myself.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and\\nmy nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged\\nme to go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was\\nin the year 1694.\\n\\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\\nthe Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I\\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were\\nsubjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them\\u2014a\\nhistory, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful\\naccidents as my own part\\u2014particularly, also, as to their battles with\\nthe Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the\\nimprovement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made\\nan attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and five\\nwomen prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young\\nchildren on the island.\\n\\nHere I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary\\nthings, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two\\nworkmen, which I had brought from England with me, viz. a carpenter and\\na smith.\\n\\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to\\nmyself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively\\nas they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged\\nthem not to leave the place, I left them there.\\n\\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which\\nI bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides\\nother supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for\\nservice, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,\\nI promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of\\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting\\u2014which I\\nafterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and\\ndiligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart\\nfor them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them\\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again\\nwere considerably increased.\\n\\nBut all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came\\nand invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought\\nwith that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of\\nthem killed; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies\\u2019 canoes,\\nthey famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and\\nrecovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the\\nisland.\\n\\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new\\nadventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther\\naccount of in the Second Part of my Story.\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 2178,\n            'f': \"2178\",\n        }]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"number\", \"sect_no\"], [\"string\", \"sect_raw\"], [\"number\", \"sent_no_start\"], [\"number\", \"sent_no_mid\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n    ",
