Miranda served six months, three in Holloway, the rest
in an open prison north of Ipswich. Like many middle-class,
educated criminals before her, she put in for a job in the prison
library. But a number of famous poll-tax martyrs were still

prison. I accustomed myself to her misery. Another surprise
was Maxfield's equanimity. There was no avoiding it, Miranda
had to tell him the entire story. He applauded the motives for
her crime, and just as easily accepted her punishment. He had

to be searched and checked in and out, we chatted cheerfully,
