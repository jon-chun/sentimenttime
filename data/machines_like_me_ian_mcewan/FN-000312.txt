life could afford. Love, and a child. I had a sense of being borne
helplessly away by events on a downstream flood. Frightening,
delicious. Here at last was my river. And Mark. The little danc-

look more or less did it. Living alone in the wedding-cake
house was unthinkable. Living there just with her was no
longer on offer. He was a lovely boy, a wonderful cause. Within
