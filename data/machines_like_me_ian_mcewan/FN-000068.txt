Ian Mc E wan
He was advertised as a companion, an intellectual spar-
ring partner, friend and factotum who could wash dishes,
make beds and "think." Every moment of his existence, every-
thing he heard and saw, he recorded and could retrieve. He
couldn't drive as yet and was not allowed to swim or shower or
go out in the rain without an umbrella, or operate a chainsaw
unsupervised. As for range, thanks to breakthroughs in elec-
trical storage, he could run seventeen kilometres in two hours
without a charge or, its energy equivalent, converse non-stop
for twelve days. He had a working life of twenty years. He
was compactly built, square-shouldered, dark-skinned, with
thick black hair swept back; narrow in the face, with a hint of
hooked nose suggestive of fierce intelligence, pensively hooded
eyes, tight lips that, even as we watched, were draining of their
deathly yellowish-white tint and acquiring rich human colour,
perhaps even relaxing a little at the corners. Miranda said he
resembled "a docker from the Bosphorus."
Before us sat the ultimate plaything, the dream of ages,
the triumph of humanism—or its angel of death. Exciting
beyond measure, but frustrating too. Sixteen hours was a long
time to be waiting and watching. I thought that for the sum
I'd handed over after lunch, Adam should have been charged
up and ready to go. It was a wintry late afternoon. I made
toast and we drank more coffee. Miranda, a doctoral scholar of
social history, said she wished the teenage Mary Shelley
here beside us, observing closely, not a monster like Franken-
stein's, but this handsome dark-skinned young
life. I said that what both creatures shared was a hunger for
the animating force of electricity.
