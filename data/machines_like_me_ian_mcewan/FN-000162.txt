"He's not a vibrator."
She brought the coffee to the table and sat down close to
me. She was being kindly, concerned, in effect casting me
as the sulking child, trying to make me forget that she was
ten years my junior. What was passing between us was our
most intimate exchange so far. Hostile? She had never before
referred to any mood-state of mine.
She said, "He has as much consciousness as one."
"Vibrators don't have opinions. They don't weed the gar-
den. He looks like a man. Another man."
"D'you know, when he has an erection—"
"I don't want to hear about it."
"He told me. His cock fills with distilled water. From a
reservoir in his right buttock."
This was comforting but I was determined to be cool.
"That's what all men say."
She laughed. I had never seen her so light and free. "I'm
trying to remind you. He's a fucking machine."
A fucking machine.
"It was gross, Miranda. If I humped an inflatable sex doll
you'd feel the same."
"I wouldn't get tragic about it. I wouldn't think you were
having an affair."
"But you are. It'll happen again." I hadn't intended to con-
cede that possibility. It was a rhetorical parry, a cue for her to
contradict me. But I was somewhat provoked by "tragic."
I said, "If I was ripping a sex doll apart with a knife, you'd
be right to be worried."
"I don't see the connection."
