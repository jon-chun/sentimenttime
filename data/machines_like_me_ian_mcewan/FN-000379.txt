the side of the cupboard, knees drawn up. He resembled a man
who had drifted to the bottom of a dry well. Hard not to think
he was biding his time. His black shoes shone, the laces were
tied, both hands rested in his lap. Had I placed them there?
His complexion was unchanged. He looked healthy. In repose,
the face was thoughtful rather than cruel.
I was reluctant to touch him. As I put a hand on his
shoulder, I tentatively said his name, and then again, as if I
was trying to keep a hostile dog at bay. My plan was to top-
ple him towards me, then ease him out of the cupboard onto
the stretcher. I cupped my free hand round his neck, which
seemed warm to the touch, and pulled him over, onto his side.
Before he hit the cupboard floor, I caught him in an awkward
embrace. This was a dead weight. The fabric of his suit jacket
became bunched up against my face as I lowered him. 1 got
my hands into his armpits and, with immense difficulty and
much grunting, twisted him onto his back while dragging
him from his confinement. Not easy. The jacket was tight and
silky, my grip was poor. The legs remained bent. A form of
rigor mortis, perhaps. I thought I might be doing damage but
I was beginning not to care. I pulled him out, inches at a time,
and rolled him onto the stretcher. I straightened his legs by
pushing down on his knees with my foot. For Mirandas ben-
efit, I covered him, face included, with the blanket.
Enough magical thought. My attitude now was brisk. I
went outside to open up the van doors, then fetched Miranda.
When she saw the covered form, she shook her head.
"Looks like a dead body. Better to uncover his face and tell
people it's a mannequin."
