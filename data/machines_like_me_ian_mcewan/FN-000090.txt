their land were humans or spirits. They returned to their vil-
lage to discuss the matter, leaving a teenage boy behind to spy
from a distance. The question was settled when he reported
back that one of Leahy's colleagues had gone behind a bush
to defecate. Here, in my kitchen in 1982, not many years later,

Adam had an operating system as well as a nature—that is, a
human nature—and a personality, the one I hoped Miranda
would help provide. I was unsure how these three substrates
overlapped or reacted with each other. When I studied anthro-

own cultures. One of my teachers liked to quote Kipling—"And

of social studies was dismissive, sometimes furious. To speak
of genes in relation to people's behaviour evoked memories of
Hitlers 1 hird Reich, fashions change. But Adam's makers
