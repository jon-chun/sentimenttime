"All right," I said. "But you go first."
Two minor sex scandals followed by resignations, one fatal
heart attack, one fatal, drunken collision on a country road, one
member crossing the floor on a matter of principle—in seven
months the government had lost four consecutive by-elections,
its majority had narrowed by five and was hanging, as the
newspapers kept saying, "by a thread." This thread was nine
seats thick, but Mrs. Thatcher had at least twelve rebellious
backbenchers whose main concern was that the recently passed
"poll tax" legislation would destroy the party's hopes at the
next general election. The tax financed local government and
replaced the old system based on the rental value of a house.
Every adult aged over eighteen was now levied at a flat rate,
regardless of income, but with reduced charges on students,
the poor and the registered unemployed. The new tax was pre-
sented to Parliament sooner than anyone expected, though the
prime minister had had plans drawn up seven years before,
when she was Leader of the Opposition. It had been in the par-
ty's manifesto, but no one had taken it seriously. Now here it
was, on the statute book, "a tax on existence," difficult to col-
lect and generally unpopular. Mrs. Thatcher had survived the
Falklands defeat. Now, still in her first term, it was possible she
would be toppled by her own legislative mistake, "an unpar-
donable act," said a Times leader, "of mystifying self-harm."
