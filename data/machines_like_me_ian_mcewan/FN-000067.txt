Machines Like Me

While his batteries began to charge, I made us coffee,
then scrolled through the 470-page online handbook. Its lan-
guage was mostly clear and precise. But Adam was created
across different agencies and in places the instructions had the
charm of a nonsense poem. "Unreveal upside of B347k vest to
gain carefree emoticon with motherboard output to attenuate
mood-swing penumbra."
At last, with cardboard and polystyrene wrapping strewn
around his ankles, he sat naked at my tiny dining table, eyes
closed, a black power line trailing from the entry point in
his umbilicus to a thirteen-amp socket in the wall. It would
take sixteen hours to fire him up. Then sessions of download
updates and personal preferences. I wanted him now, and so
did Miranda. Like eager young parents, we were avid for his
first words. There was no loudspeaker cheaply buried in his
chest. We knew from the excited publicity that he formed
sounds with breath, tongue, teeth and palate. Already his life-
like skin was warm to the touch and as smooth as a child's.
Miranda claimed to see his eyelashes flicker. I was certain she
was seeing vibrations from the Tube trains rolling a hundred
feet below us, but I said nothing.
Adam was not a sex toy. However, he was capable of sex
and possessed functional mucous membranes, in the mainte-
nance of which he consumed half a litre of water each day.
While he sat at the table, I observed that he was uncircum-
cised, fairly well endowed, with copious dark pubic hair. This
highly advanced model of artificial human was likely to
reflect the appetites of its young creators of code. The Adams
and Eves, it was thought, would be lively.
