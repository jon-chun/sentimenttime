Machines Like Me

gia for my life as it was before Gorringe, Adam, even Miranda.
As an existence, it had been insufficient but relatively simple.
Simpler still if I'd left my mother's money in the bank.
Here was my lover at the table, beautiful and outwardly com-
posed. As I sat down, it wasn't irritation I felt towards her,
though that wasn't far off. More like detachment. I saw what
must have been obvious to everyone—her secretiveness; also,
her inability to ask for help, her trick of getting it anyway,
and of never being held to account. I sat down, drank a little
wine, listened to the conversation—and made a decision. Set-
ting aside Adam's reassurances, I believed she had brought a
murderer into my life. I was expected to help, and I would. But
she had told me nothing. Now I was calling in a debt.
We were looking right at each other. I couldn't keep the
terseness out of my voice. "Did he rape you or not?"
After a pause, during which she continued to hold my
gaze, she shook her head slowly from side to side and then she
said softly, "No."
I waited. She waited. Adam went to speak. I silenced
him with a slight shake of the head. When it was clear that
Miranda was not going to say more-—the very reticence that
was oppressing me—I said, "You lied to the court."
"Yes."
"You sent an innocent man to prison."
She sighed.
Again, I waited. My patience was running out, but I didn't
raise my voice. "Miranda. This is stupid. What happened?"
She was looking down at her hands. To my relief, she said,
as though to herself, "It'll take a while."
