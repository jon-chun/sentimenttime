"The issue isn't Adam's state of mind. It's yours."
"Oh, in that case . . ." She turned towards Adam, lifted
his lifeless hand an inch or so above the table and let it drop.
"Suppose I told you that I love him. My ideal man. Brilliant
lover, textbook technique, inexhaustible. Never hurt by any-
thing I say or do. Considerate, obedient even, and knowledge-
able, good conversation. Strong as a dray horse. Great with the
housework. His breath smells like the back of a warm TV set,
but I can live with—"
"OK. Enough."
Her sarcasm, a novel register, was delivered with much
variation of pitch. I thought the performance was mean in
spirit. For all I knew, she was hiding the truth in plain sight. She
patted Adam's wrist as she smiled at me. In triumph or by way
of apology, I couldn't tell. I was bound to suspect that a night
of exceptional sex was the cause of this taunting, airy-headed
manner. She was harder than ever to read. I wondered if I could
break with her completely. Take back Adam as my own, retrieve
the spare charging cable from upstairs, restore Miranda to her
role as neighbour and friend, distant friend. In the manner of
thought, the idea was no more than a spark of irritation. The
notion that immediately followed was that I could never be free
of her and would never want to be—most of the time. Here she
was beside me, close enough for me to feel her summer-morning
body warmth. Beautiful, pale-skinned, smooth, in bridal white,
gazing on me again with affectionate concern now that her
teasing was done. The look was new. It could be—this was an
encouraging thought—that a clever device had performed a
service, loosening Miranda's warmer feelings.
