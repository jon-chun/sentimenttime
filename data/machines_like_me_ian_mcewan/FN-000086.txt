upstairs. Back from Salisbury. Wandering in and out of her
bedroom. Once again I felt the troubled thrill of undeclared
love, and that was when I had the first stirrings of an idea.
That afternoon I should have been making and los-
ing money at my computer. Instead, I watched from the
great height of a helicopter as the leading ships of the Task
Force rounded Portland Bill and filed by Chesil Beach. The
very place names deserved a respectful salute. How brilliant.
Onwards! I kept thinking. And then, Go back! Soon the fleet
came along the Jurassic coast, where herds of dinosaurs once
grazed on giant ferns. Suddenly we were down among the
people of Lyme Regis gathering on the Cobb. Some had bin-
oculars, many had the very flags I had in mind, plastic on a
wooden stick. A news team might have handed them around.
Vox pops. Gentle local voices of hard-working women, tight
with emotion. Tough old coves who'd fought in Crete and
Normandy, nodding to themselves, giving nothing away. Oh,
how I wished I too believed. But I could! A long lens mounted
somewhere on the Lizard showed the tiny receding blobs of
ships heading bravely out onto the big swell of the open sea to
the sound of husky Rod Stewart, while I tried not to be tearful.
W hat turmoil on a weekday afternoon. A new kind of
being at my dining table, the woman I newly loved six feet
above my head, and the country at old-fashioned war. But I
was tolerably disciplined and had promised myself seven hours
every day. I turned off the I V and went to my screen. Waiting
for me was the email from Miranda that I'd hoped for.
