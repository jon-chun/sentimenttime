up, he contemplated the mathematics and the basic texts. He
read Schrodinger's Dublin lectures, What Is Life?, from which
he concluded that he was alive. He read the transcript of the
celebrated 1927 Solvay conference, when the luminaries of
physics met to discuss photons and electrons.
"It was said that at these early Solvay meetings there took
place the most profound exchanges about nature in the history
of ideas."
I was at breakfast. I told him I'd once read that the elderly
Einstein, while at Princeton in his final years, started each
day with eggs fried in butter and that in Adam's honour, I was
frying two now for myself.
Adam said, "People said he never grasped what he himself
had started. Solvay was a battlefield for him. Outnumbered,
poor fellow. By extraordinary young men. But that was unfair.
The young Turks weren't concerned with what nature is, only
with what one could say about it. Whereas Einstein thought
there was no science without belief in an external world inde-
pendent of the observer. He didn't think quantum mechanics
was wrong so much as incomplete."
This after one night's study. I remembered my hopeless
brief entanglement with physics at college, before I found
safety in anthropology. 1 suppose I was a little jealous, espe-
cially when I learned that Adam had got his mind round
Dirac's equation. 1 cited Richard Feynman's remark that any-
one who claims to understand quantum theory doesn't under-
stand quantum theory.
Adam shook his head. "A bogus paradox, if it's even a par-
adox at all. Tens of thousands understand it, millions make
