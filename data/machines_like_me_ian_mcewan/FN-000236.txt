I agreed to call on him. I could hardly sleep for thinking and
planning. 1 would never have imagined that hatred could

drunk too much and wouldn't be convincing in front of the
desk sergeant. But it worked out well enough in the morning.
I made a point of not changing my clothes or washing. So, no
shortage of evidence in the right places. The new genetic test
had been introduced across the country by then. The police
weren't as unfriendly as I'd feared from what I'd read in the
newspapers. They weren't particularly sympathetic either.
They were efficient, and keen to try out their new DNA kit.
