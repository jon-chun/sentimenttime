Machines Like Me

defeat, the elderly go master, helped by an assistant, stood
slowly, bowed towards the laptop and congratulated it in a
trembling voice. He said, "The mounted horse did not kill ath-
letics. We run for joy." He was right. The game, with its simple
rules and boundless complexity, became even more popular.
As with the post-war defeat of a chess grandmaster, the tri-
umph of the machine could not diminish the game. Winning,
it was said, was less important than pleasure in the intricacies
of the contest. But the idea that there was now software that
could eerily, accurately "read" a situation, or a face, a gesture
or the emotional timbre of a remark was never dislodged and
partly explained the interest when the Adams and Eves came
on the market.
Fifteen years is a long time in computer science. The pro-
cessing power and sophistication of my Adam was far greater
than that of the go computer. The technology advanced and
Turing moved on. He spent concentrated time looking at
decision-making and wrote a celebrated book: we are disposed
to make patterns, narratives, when we should be thinking
probabilistically if we want to make good choices. Artificial
intelligence could improve on what we had, on what we were.
Turing devised the algorithms. All his innovative work was
available to others. Adam must have benefited.
Turing's institute drove forward AI and computational
biology. He said he wasn't interested in becoming richer than
he already was. Hundreds of prominent scientists followed
his example on open-source publication, which would lead, in
1987, to the collapse of the journals Nature and Science. He was
much criticised for that. Others said that his work had created
