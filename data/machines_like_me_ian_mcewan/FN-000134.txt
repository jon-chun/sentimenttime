my way along the street, as though on rubber wheels, to my
home, the centre of my preoccupations, which had lately
shifted from Miranda back to Adam.
His character was in, done, from two sources irreversibly

I noted that a certain blankness had gone from his face, that
he seemed more intact, smoother in his interactions with
