the case against other circumstantial factors that are also not
generally available."
"Clever."
"Thank you."
"Tell me about the case. And the date and place."
" I he young man, you see, knew very well that the first
time he had intimate relations with her . . ."

guessed my short run of discovery was coming to a close. He
appeared now to know about the value of reticence.
"Go on."
"Uh, she brought along a half-bottle of vodka."
