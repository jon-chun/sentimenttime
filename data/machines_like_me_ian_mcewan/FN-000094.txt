nothing like cooking to bring one back into the world's better
side, its long history of catering to others. I looked over my
shoulder. It was startling, the effect of the clothes. He sat there,
elbows on the table like some old pal of mine, waiting for me
to pour the first glass of the evening.
I called out to him, "I'm roasting a chicken with butter
and tarragon." It was mischievous of me, knowing his plain
diet of electrons.
Without pausing, and in the flattest of tones, he said,
I hey go well together. But it's easy to burn the leaves when
you're browning the bird."
Browning the bird? It was correct, I guessed, but it sounded
odd.
"What d'you advise?"
Cover the chicken with tinfoil. From the size of it I'd say
seventy minutes at 180. "I hen brush the leaves off into the juice
while you brown at the same temperature for fifteen minutes
without the foil. I hen pour the tarragon back on with the
juices and melted butter."
"Thanks."
Remember to let it stand under a cloth for ten minutes
before you carve."
"I know about that."
"Sorry."
Did I sound tetchy? By the early eighties we were long
used to talking to machines, in our cars and homes, to call
tres and health clinics. But Adam had weighed up my chicken
from across the room and apologised for the extraneous advice.
