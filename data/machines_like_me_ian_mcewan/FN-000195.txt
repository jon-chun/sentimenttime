Wasn't that of nature, and wasn't this old hat, men thinking of

intuitive Euclidean proof? I couldn't think of one. But after
half an hour of fast walking, I thought I'd found the mathe-

emptier expanses of the Common. A good way off, on all sides,
the traffic turned about me like planets. Usually it oppressed
me to reflect that every car contained a nexus of worries, mem-
ories and hopes as vital and complicated as my own. Today I
welcomed and forgave everyone. We would all turn out well.
We were all bound together in our own overlapping but dis-
tinct forms of comedy. Others might also have a lover living
with a death threat. But no one else with an arm in a cast had
a machine for a love rival.
