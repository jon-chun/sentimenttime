"He'll sleep for hours."
By a brick and cast-iron greenhouse with mossy windows
there was a water butt and a stone trough. Below it, she showed
me a dark, wet place where they used to hunt for crested newts.
There were none now. Wrong time of year. We walked on and
I thought I could smell the river. I pictured a ruined boathouse
and a sunken punt. We came past a potting shed by brick com-
post bins that stood empty. There were three willows ahead
of us and my hopes for the Avon rose. We ducked through the
wet branches onto a second lawn, also recently mowed and
surrounded on two sides by shrubbery. The garden ended in
an orange brick wall with crumbling mortar pointing, and
pleached fruit trees that had become detached and run wild.
Along the wall was a wooden bench facing back towards the
house, though the view did not extend past the willows.
This was where we sat in silence for several minutes, still
holding hands.
Then she said, "The last time we came here was to talk
about what happened. Again. In those days before I went off
to France, that was all we could talk about. What he did, what
she felt, how her parents must never know. And all around us
here was the history of our lives together, our childhoods, our
teenage years, exams. We used to come and revise here, test
each other. We had a portable radio and we argued about pop
songs. We drank a bottle of wine once. We smoked some hash
and hated it. We were both sick, right over there. When we
were thirteen, we showed each other our breasts. We used to
practise handstands and cartwheels on the grass."
She went silent again. I squeezed her hand and waited.
