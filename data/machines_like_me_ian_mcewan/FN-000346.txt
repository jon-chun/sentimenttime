"I've never seen a dinosaur's toenail."
"No," he agreed pleasantly. "You haven't."
"Do you want to show me?"
He pointed straight at Miranda. It was a change of subject.
"She's going to be my new mummy."
"What do you think about that?"
"You're going to be the daddy."
What he thought was not a question he could respond to.
He said quietly, "Dinosaurs are all extinct anyway."
"I agree."
"They're all dead. They can't come back."
I heard the uncertainty in his voice. I said, "They abso-
lutely can't come back."
He gave me a serious look. "Nothing comes back."
I got halfway through my therapeutically supportive,
kindly reply. What I was starting to say was, "The past is
extinct," when he interrupted me with a shout, but a happy one.
"I don't like sitting on this chair!"
I went to help him down but he leapt with a shriek onto
the floor, into a crouching position, and then he jumped and
crouched again, shouting, "I'm a frog! A frog!"
He was hopping across the floor as a very loud frog when
two things happened at once. Miranda came off the phone and
told Mark to keep his noise down. At the same time, the door
opened and Adam was before us. The room fell silent. Mark
scurried for Miranda's hand.
I knew that depleted look. Otherwise, Adam looked, as
ever, well groomed in white shirt and dark suit.
"Are you all right?" I said.
