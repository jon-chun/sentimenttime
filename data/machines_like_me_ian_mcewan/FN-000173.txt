from Miranda to me. By this time we were both standing.
Adam prised from the child's fist the envelope and passed it to
me. It was as soft and limp as suede from much use and had
some additions and crossings-out on it in pencil. Inside was
the card I'd given to the boy's father. On the back was a note in
thick black upper-case letters. "You wanted him."
I passed it to Miranda and looked back at the boy, then I
remembered his name.
I said in the kindliest way, "Hello, Mark. How did you get
here?"
By this time Miranda, making a soft, sympathetic sound,
was going towards him. But he was no longer looking in our
direction. Instead, he was gazing up at Adam, whose finger he
still gripped.
He might have been in shock, but the little boy showed
no outward signs of distress. He would have been better off
crying, for he gave an impression of inner struggle. He stood
among strangers in the alien kitchen, shoulders back, chest
out, trying to be large and brave. At just over a metre high,
he was doing his best. His sandals suggested an older sister.
Where was she? I had told Miranda about the encounter in
the swing park and she had understood the note. She tried
to put her arms round Mark's shoulders but he shrugged her
off. It was possible he'd never been taught the luxury of being
comforted. Adam stood still and upright and the boy kept firm
hold of the reassuring finger.
