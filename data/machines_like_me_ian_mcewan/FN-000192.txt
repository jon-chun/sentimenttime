positioned my forefinger, he turned in his chair and his right
hand rose up to encircle my wrist. The grip was ferocious. As
it grew tighter, I dropped to my knees and concentrated on
denying him the satisfaction of the slightest murmur of pain,
even when I heard something snap.
Adam heard it too and was instantly apologetic. He let go
of me. "Charlie, I believe I've broken something. I really didn't
mean to. I'm truly sorry. Are you in a lot of pain? But please,
I don't want you or Miranda ever to touch that place again."
I discovered the next morning, after a five-hour wait and
an X-ray in the local Accident and Emergency department,
that an important bone in my wrist was compromised. It was a
messy break, a partly displaced scaphoid fracture, and it would
take months to heal.
