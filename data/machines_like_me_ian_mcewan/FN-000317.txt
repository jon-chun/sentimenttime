it an entrance marked by two red brick pillars and a sign,
St. Osmund's Close. The houses were identical, large by mod-
ern standards, each set in a quarter-acre plot, with a double
garage, and constructed of brick, white weather boarding and
much plate glass. The closely mown and striped front lawns
were unfenced, American style. There was no clutter, no kids'
bikes or games on the grass.
"It's number six," Adam said.
I stopped, cut the engine, and in silence we looked towards
the house. We could see through the picture window into the
living room and the backyard beyond, where a clothes-drying
tree stood bare. There was no sign of life here or anywhere else
in the close.
I was gripping the steering wheel tightly in one hand.
"He's not in."
"I'll ring the bell," Miranda said as she got out of the car.
I had no choice. I followed her to the front door. Adam was
behind me, rather too far back, I thought. On the second ring
of the "Oranges and Lemons" door chimes, we heard footsteps
on the stairs. I was now standing close by Miranda's side. Her
face was strained and I could see a tremor in her upper arm. At
the sound of a hand on the latch, she took a half-pace closer to
the door. My hand hovered near her elbow. As the door opened,
I feared she was about to leap forward in some wild physical
assault.
The wrong man, was my first thought. An older brother,
even a young uncle. He was certainly large, but the face was
gaunt, hollow in the unshaven cheeks that already showed
vertical lines each side of his nose. Otherwise, he looked lean.
