mown lawn, with her back to me, standing still, looking in
the direction of an old, partly dead apple tree, much of whose
fruit was rotting on the ground. The early afternoon light was
grey and bright, the air was warm, and damp after the recent
rain. There was a heavy scent of other fruits left to wasps and
birds. I was standing at the head of a short run of mottled York
stone steps. The garden was twice the width of the house and
very long, perhaps 200 or 300 yards. I wondered if it ran all the
way to the River Avon, like some did in Salisbury. If I'd been
alone, I would have gone straight down to look. The idea of a
river prompted in me a notion of freedom. From what exactly,
I didn't know. I went down the steps, deliberately scuffing my
heels to let her know I was there.
If she heard me, she didn't turn. When I was standing
beside her, she put her hand in mine and indicated with a nod.
"Just under there. We called it the palace."
We walked over to it. Round the base of the apple tree
were nettles and a few straggling hollyhocks still in flower. No
traces of a camp.
"We had an old carpet, cushions, books, special emergency
supplies of lemonade, chocolate biscuits."
We went further down, passing a patch enclosed by hur-
dles where gooseberry and blackcurrant plants were choked by
nettles and goosegrass, then a tiny orchard and more forgotten
fruit, and beyond, behind a picket fence, what must once have
been a cut-flower garden.
When she asked, I told her that Maxfield was asleep.
"How did you two get on?"
"We talked about beauty."
