ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I am deeply grateful to all those who gave their time to an
early draft of this novel: Annalena McAfee, Tim Garton Ash, Galen
Strawson, Ray Dolan, Richard Eyre, Peter Straus, Dan Franklin,
Nan Talese, Jaco and Elizabeth Groot, Louise Dennys, Ray Nein-
stein and Kathy Nemser, Ana Fletcher and David Milner. I make
an exclusive claim to any remaining errors. I'm indebted to a long
conversation with Demis Hassabis (b.1976) and to Andrew Hodges's
magisterial biography of Alan Turing (d.1954).
