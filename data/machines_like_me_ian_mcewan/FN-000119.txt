Together we walked away from his parents, across the
playground to the spring-hinged gate.
The little boy said in a loud whisper, "Let's pretend to run
away." His upturned face was suddenly alive with humour
and mischief.
"OK."
"On a boat."
"All right."
I was about to open the gate when there was a shout
behind me. I turned, hoping that my relief didn't show. The
woman came running at me, pulled the boy away and swung
at me with an open hand. The blow fell harmlessly against my
upper arm.
"Pervert!"
She was ready to take another swing when John called out
in a weary tone. "Leave it."
I let myself out and walked a little way before stopping to
look back. John was hoisting Mark onto his raw shoulders. I had
to admire the father. There may have been wit in his methods
which I'd failed to notice. He had got rid of me without a fight
by making an impossible offer. What a nightmare, to drag the
boy back to my tiny place, introduce him to Miranda, then
see to his needs for the next fifteen years. I noticed that the
woman had a black ribbon tied to the arm of her coat. She
was trying to persuade John to take his shirt. He was ignoring
her. As the family crossed the playground, Mark turned in my
direction and raised an arm, perhaps to maintain his balance,
perhaps in farewell.
