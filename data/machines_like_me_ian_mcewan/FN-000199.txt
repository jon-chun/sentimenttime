by calling in her text records.
A week later, before sentencing, there were pleas of miti-

his innocence, as the intentions of a wronged man looking for
redress. A guilty man could be furious at his loss of freedom.
If he could threaten to kill, he could surely rape.
Beyond the either-or was a dangerous middle ground
where the half-forgotten student anthropologist in me could

The story of the missing texts was particular, inventive,
easily verified or disproved. By telling it to the court, Gorringe
