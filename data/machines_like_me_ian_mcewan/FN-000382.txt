I knew was getting to King's Cross. But now my progress was
blocked. Trafalgar Square was packed tight for speeches. We
approached on an explosion of applause and shouting. The lit-
ter under my feet, thin streamers of fine plastic, tangled with
the wheels. I risked being trampled by going down below knee
level to pull the mess clear. It was going to take me a long
time to reach the Charing Cross Road, 200 yards away. No
one wanted or was able to give way. It was no easier to retreat
than to advance. All the side streets were filling now. The
din, the clatter, the foghorns, bass drums, whistles and chants
were both thunderous and piercing. As I fought to edge His
Lordship forward, I penetrated—but so slowly—layers of dis-
appointment and anger, confusion and blame. Poverty, unem-
ployment, housing, healthcare and care for the old, education,
crime, race, gender, climate, opportunity—every old problem
of social existence remained unsolved, according to all the
voices, placards, t-shirts and banners. Who could doubt them?
It was a great clamour for something better. And pushing my
dirty broken chair, its complaining wheel lost to the din, I
squeezed through the crowd unnoticed, with a new problem
about to be added to the rest—wondrous machines like Adam
and his kind, whose moment had not quite yet come.
Making progress up St. Martin's Lane was just as hard.
Further north, the crowds began to thin. But just as I reached
New Oxford Street, the noisy wheel locked and for the rest of
the way I had to lift and tilt the chair as well as push. I stopped
at a pub near the British Museum and drank a pint of shandy.
From there, I phoned Miranda again. Still no news.
I arrived three hours late for my appointment at York Way.
