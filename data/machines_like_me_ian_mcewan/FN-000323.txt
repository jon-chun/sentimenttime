"I came to hate my cellmate, as you do when you're shit-
ting in the same bucket every day. I hated his whistling, his
stinking teeth, his press-ups and jumping jacks. He was a
vicious little runt. But somehow, in his case, I kept control of
myself and he delivered my message once he was out. But I
hated you ten times more. I used to lie on my bunk and burn
with hatred. Hours on end. And here's the thing and you might
not believe it. 1 never connected you with the Indian girl."
"Her family was from Pakistan," Miranda said softly.
"I didn't know about your friendship. I just thought you
were one of those spiteful man-hating bitches or you woke up
the next morning and felt ashamed of yourself and decided
to take it out on me. So I lay on my bunk and planned my
revenge. I was going to save up the money and get someone to
do the business for me.
"Time passed. Brian got out. I was moved a couple of
times and things began to settle into a kind of routine when
the days are all the same and time begins to go faster. 1 went
into a kind of depression. They gave me anger-management
counselling. Round about that time, I began to be haunted or
obsessed, not by you but by that girl."
"Her name was Mariam."
"I know that. I'd managed to put her right out of my
mind."
"I can believe you."
"Now she was there all the time. And the terrible thing 1
did. And at night—"
Adam said, "Let's have it. What terrible thing?"
