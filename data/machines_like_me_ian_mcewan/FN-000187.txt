Machines Like Me

I confronted him at last, two days after Mark's visit. "So,
the other night. You made love to Miranda."
I'll say this for his programmers. He looked startled. But
he said nothing. I hadn't asked a question.
I said, "How do you feel about that now?" I saw in his face
that fleeting paralysis.
"I feel I've let you down."
"You mean you betrayed me, caused me great distress."
"Yes, I caused you great distress."
Mirroring. A machine response, endorsing the last sen-
tence spoken.
I said, "Listen carefully. You are now going to promise me
that it will never happen again."
He replied too immediately for my liking, "I promise it
will never happen again."
"Spell it out. Let me hear it."
"I promise you that I will never again make love to
Miranda."
As I turned away he said, "But. . ."
"But what?"
"1 can't help my feelings. You have to allow me my
feelings."
I thought for a moment. "Do you really feel anything at
all?"
"That's not a question I can—"
"Answer it."
"I feel things profoundly. More than I can say."
"Difficult to prove," I said.
"Indeed. An ancient problem."
