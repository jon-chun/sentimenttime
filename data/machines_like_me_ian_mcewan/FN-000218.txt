use of it. It's a matter of time, Charlie. General relativity was
once at the outer edge of difficulty. Now it's routine for first-
year undergraduates. The same was true of the calculus. Now
fourteen-year-olds can do it. One day quantum mechanics will
pass into common sense."
By this time I was eating my eggs. Adam had made the
coffee. It was far too strong. I said, "OK. What about that Sol-
vay question? Is quantum mechanics a description of nature or
just an effective way of predicting things?"
"I would have been on Einstein's side. I don't understand
the doubt about it," he said. "Quantum mechanics makes pre-
dictions to such a fabulous degree of accuracy, it must be getting
something right about nature. To creatures of our immense
size, the material world looks blurred and feels hard. But now
we know how strange and wonderful it is. So it shouldn't sur-
prise us that consciousness, your sort and mine, could arise
from an arrangement of matter—it's clearly odd to just the
right degree. And we don't have anything else to explain

Another morning, after he had told me how he had been
thinking all night of Miranda, he said, "I've also been think-

"We don't see everywhere. We can't see behind our heads.
We can't even see our chins. Let's say our field of vision is
