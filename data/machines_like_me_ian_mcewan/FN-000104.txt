with boisterous crowds of teenage girlfriends, with drunken
undergraduates. All who knew her liked her. No one on any
accessible site had a sinister story. Now and then the chatter
endorsed parts of the past she was recounting in our midnight
conversations. Elsewhere her name came up in connection
with the one academic paper she had published—"Pannage
in Swyncombe: the role of the half-wild pig in the household
economies of a medieval Chilterns village." When I read it, I
loved her more.
As for the intuitive artificial mind, it was pure urban leg-
end, begun in early 1968 when Alan Turing and his brilliant
young colleague Demis Hassabis devised software to beat one
of the world's great masters of the ancient game of go in five
straight games. Everyone in the business knew that such a feat
could not be accomplished by number-crunching force. The
possible moves in go and chess vastly exceed the number of
atoms in the observable universe, and go has exponentially
more moves than chess. Go masters are unable to explain
how they attain their supremacy beyond a profound sense
of what feels right for any given situation on the board. So it
was assumed that the computer was doing something similar.
Breathless articles in the press announced a new era of human-
ised software. Computers were on the threshold of thinking
like us, imitating our often ill-defined reasons for our judge-
ments and choices. In a counter-move and in a pioneering spirit
of open access, Turing and Hassabis put their software online.
In media interviews they described the process of machine
deep learning and neural networks. Turing attempted layman
explanations of the Monte Carlo tree search, an algorithm
