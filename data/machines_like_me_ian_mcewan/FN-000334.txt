occasions, he was taken to see her in the hospital. On the sec-
ond visit, she didn't or wouldn't recognise him. Jasmin, the
social worker, thought he'd been smacked frequently. He was
in the habit of chewing on his lower lip, to the point of draw-
ing blood. He was a fussy eater, wouldn't touch vegetables,
salad or fruit, but seemed healthy enough on a diet of junk
food. Dancing remained a passion. He could pick out tunes on
a recorder. He knew his letters and could count, by his own
boast, to thirty-five. On shoes, he knew his left from his right.
He was not so good around other children and tended to move
to the edge of a group. When asked what he wanted to be
when he grew up, he would answer, "A princess." He liked
dressing up as one with crown and wand, and "flitting about"
in an old nightie. He was happy in a borrowed summer frock.
Jasmin was relaxed about it, but her immediate superior, an
older woman, disapproved.
I remembered then something I had forgotten to tell her.
When I'd crossed the playground hand in hand with Mark,
he'd wanted us to pretend we were running away, in a boat.
She was suddenly tearful. "Oh, Mark!" she cried out.
"You're such a special beautiful kid."
After the meal, she stood to go upstairs. "I always thought
I'd have children one day. I never expected to fall in love with
this boy. But we don't choose who to love, do we?"
Later, while I was clearing up the kitchen, I had a sud-
den thought. So obvious. And dangerous. I went next door and
found Adam closing down the computer.
I sat on the edge of the bed. First I asked him about his
conversation with Miranda.
