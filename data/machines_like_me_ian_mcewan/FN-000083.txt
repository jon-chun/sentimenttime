Machines Like Me

me. Or thinking only of me. Or recalling a boy at her seminar
who'd tried to out-stare her.
I watched the TV news on my phone. A brilliant mosaic in
sound and sparkling seaside light. Portsmouth. The Task Force
ready to depart. Most of the country was in a dream-theatre,
in historical dress. Late medieval. Seventeenth century. Early
nineteenth. Ruffs, hose, hooped skirts, powdered wigs, eye-
patch, wooden legs. Accuracy was unpatriotic. Historically, we
were special and the fleet was bound for success. TV and press
encouraged a vague collective memory of enemies defeated—
the Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans twice this century, the
French from Agincourt to Waterloo. A fly-past by fighter jets.
A young man in combat gear, fresh out of Sandhurst, narrowed
his eyes as he told an interviewer of the difficulties ahead. A
superior officer spoke of his men's unshakeable resolve. I was
moved, even as I disliked it. When a massed band of Highland
pipers marched towards their ship's gangplank, my spirits
swelled. Then back to the studio for charts, arrows, logistics,
objectives, sane voices in agreement. For diplomatic moves. For
the prime minister in her trim blue suit on the steps of Down-
ing Street.
I warmed to it, even though I often declared myself against
it all. I loved my country. What a venture, what wild cour-
age. Eight thousand miles. What decent people putting their
lives at risk. I took a second coffee next door, made the bed to
give the room the appearance of a workplace, and sat down to
reflect a while on the state of the world's markets. The pros-
pect of war had sent the FTSE down a further one per cent.
