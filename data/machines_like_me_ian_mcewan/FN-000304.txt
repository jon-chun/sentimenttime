Machines Like Me

as Maxfield held out his glass towards his daughter for a refill

As Christine was collecting the plates, Miranda said, "I
think I've eaten too much." She stood and went behind her

Mariam shared in the house and garden were my interests,
not Adam's. Maxfield extended the wine bottle towards me.

undiluted Sauvignon Blanc that's going about."
Maxfield was affable. "Couldn't agree more. Who wouldn't
prefer the taste of flowers to the taste of minerals?'
