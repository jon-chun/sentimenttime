But remember, please, the Law by which we live,
We are not built to comprehend a lie ...

It was religious yearning granted hope, it was the holy
grail of science. Our ambitions ran high and low--for a
creation myth made real, for a monstrous act of self-love.
As soon as it was feasible, we had no choice but to follow our
desires and hang the consequences. In loftiest terms, we aimed
to escape our mortality, confront or even replace the Godhead
with a perfect self. More practically, we intended to devise an
improved, more modern version of ourselves and exult in the
joy of invention, the thrill of mastery. In the autumn of the
twentieth century, it came about at last, the first step towards
the fulfilment of an ancient dream, the beginning of the long
lesson we would teach ourselves that however complicated we
were, however faulty and difficult to describe in even our sim-
plest actions and modes of being, we could be imitated and
bettered. And I was there as a young man, an early and eager
adopter in that chilly dawn.
But artificial humans were a cliche long before they
arrived, so when they did, they seemed to some a disappoint-
ment. The imagination, fleeter than history, than technologi-
cal advance, had already rehearsed this future in books, then

films and TV dramas, as if human actors, walking with a cer-
tain glazed look, phony head movements, some stiffness in the
lower back, could prepare us for life with our cousins from the
future.
I was among the optimists, blessed by unexpected funds
following my mother's death and the sale of the family home,
which turned out to be on a valuable development site. The
first truly viable manufactured human with plausible intel-
ligence and looks, believable motion and shifts of expression,
went on sale the week before the Falklands Task Force set off
on its hopeless mission. Adam cost PS86,000. I brought him
home in a hired van to my unpleasant flat in north Clapham.
I'd made a reckless decision, but I was encouraged by reports
that Sir Alan Turing, war hero and presiding genius of the
digital age, had taken delivery of the same model. Fie probably
wanted to have his lab take it apart to examine its workings
fully.
Twelve of this first edition were called Adam, thirteen
were called Eve. Corny, everyone agreed, but commercial.
Notions of biological race being scientifically discredited,
the twenty-five were designed to cover a range of ethnicities.
There were rumours, then complaints, that the Arab could not
be told apart from the Jew. Random programming as well as
life experience would grant to all complete latitude in sexual
preference. By the end of the first week, all the Eves sold out.
At a careless glance, I might have taken my Adam for a Turk
or a Greek. He weighed 170 pounds, so I had to ask my upstairs
neighbour, Miranda, to help me carry him in from the street
on the disposable stretcher that came with the purchase.

While his batteries began to charge, I made us coffee,
then scrolled through the 470-page online handbook. Its lan-
guage was mostly clear and precise. But Adam was created
across different agencies and in places the instructions had the
charm of a nonsense poem. "Unreveal upside of B347k vest to
gain carefree emoticon with motherboard output to attenuate
mood-swing penumbra."
At last, with cardboard and polystyrene wrapping strewn
around his ankles, he sat naked at my tiny dining table, eyes
closed, a black power line trailing from the entry point in
his umbilicus to a thirteen-amp socket in the wall. It would
take sixteen hours to fire him up. Then sessions of download
updates and personal preferences. I wanted him now, and so
did Miranda. Like eager young parents, we were avid for his
first words. There was no loudspeaker cheaply buried in his
chest. We knew from the excited publicity that he formed
sounds with breath, tongue, teeth and palate. Already his life-
like skin was warm to the touch and as smooth as a child's.
Miranda claimed to see his eyelashes flicker. I was certain she
was seeing vibrations from the Tube trains rolling a hundred
feet below us, but I said nothing.
Adam was not a sex toy. However, he was capable of sex
and possessed functional mucous membranes, in the mainte-
nance of which he consumed half a litre of water each day.
While he sat at the table, I observed that he was uncircum-
cised, fairly well endowed, with copious dark pubic hair. This
highly advanced model of artificial human was likely to
reflect the appetites of its young creators of code. The Adams
and Eves, it was thought, would be lively.

He was advertised as a companion, an intellectual spar-
ring partner, friend and factotum who could wash dishes,
make beds and "think." Every moment of his existence, every-
thing he heard and saw, he recorded and could retrieve. He
couldn't drive as yet and was not allowed to swim or shower or
go out in the rain without an umbrella, or operate a chainsaw
unsupervised. As for range, thanks to breakthroughs in elec-
trical storage, he could run seventeen kilometres in two hours
without a charge or, its energy equivalent, converse non-stop
for twelve days. He had a working life of twenty years. He
was compactly built, square-shouldered, dark-skinned, with
thick black hair swept back; narrow in the face, with a hint of
hooked nose suggestive of fierce intelligence, pensively hooded
eyes, tight lips that, even as we watched, were draining of their
deathly yellowish-white tint and acquiring rich human colour,
perhaps even relaxing a little at the corners. Miranda said he
resembled "a docker from the Bosphorus."
Before us sat the ultimate plaything, the dream of ages,
the triumph of humanism--or its angel of death. Exciting
beyond measure, but frustrating too. Sixteen hours was a long
time to be waiting and watching. I thought that for the sum
I'd handed over after lunch, Adam should have been charged
up and ready to go. It was a wintry late afternoon. I made
toast and we drank more coffee. Miranda, a doctoral scholar of
social history, said she wished the teenage Mary Shelley

stein's, but this handsome dark-skinned young
life. I said that what both creatures shared was a hunger for
the animating force of electricity.

"We share it too." She spoke as though she was referring
only to herself and me, rather than all of electrochemically
charged humanity.
She was twenty-two, mature for her years and ten years
younger than me. From a long perspective, there was not
much between us. We were gloriously young. But I considered
myself at a different stage of life. My formal education was far
behind me. I'd suffered a series of professional and financial
and personal failures. I regarded myself as too hard-bitten, too
cynical for a lovely young woman like Miranda. And though
she was beautiful, with pale brown hair and a long thin face,
and eyes that often appeared narrowed by suppressed mirth,
and though in certain moods I looked at her in wonder, I'd
decided early on to confine her in the role of kind, neighbourly
friend. We shared an entrance hall and her tiny apartment
was right over mine. We saw each other for a coffee now and
then to talk about relationships and politics and all the rest.
With pitch-perfect neutrality she gave the impression of being
at ease with the possibilities. To her, it seemed, an afternoon
of intimate pleasure with me would have weighed equally
with a chaste and companionable chat. She was relaxed in my
company and I preferred to think that sex would ruin every-
thing. We remained good chums. But there was something
alluringly secretive or restrained about her. Perhaps, without
knowing it, I had been in love with her for months. Without
knowing it? What a flimsy formulation that was!
Reluctantly, we agreed to turn our backs on Adam and on
each other for a while. Miranda had a seminar to attend north
of the river, I had emails to write. By the early seventies, digi-

tal communication had discarded its air of convenience and
become a daily chore. Likewise the 250 mph trains--crowded
and dirty. Speech-recognition software, a fifties miracle, had
long turned to drudge, with entire populations sacrificing
hours each day to lonely soliloquising. Brain--machine inter-
facing, wild fruit of sixties optimism, could barely arouse the
interest of a child. What people queued the entire weekend for
became, six months later, as interesting as the socks on their
feet. What happened to the cognition-enhancing helmets, the
speaking fridges with a sense of smell? Gone the way of the
mouse pad, the Filofax, the electric carving knife, the fondue
set. The future kept arriving. Our bright new toys began to
rust before we could get them home, and life went on much
as before.
Would Adam become a bore? It's not easy, to dictate while
trying to ward off a bout of buyer's remorse. Surely other peo-
ple, other minds, must continue to fascinate us. As artificial
people became more like us, then became us, then became
more than us, we could never tire of them. They were bound
to surprise us. They might fail us in ways that were beyond
our imagining. Tragedy was a possibility, but not boredom.
What was tedious was the prospect of the user's guide.
Instructions. My prejudice was that any machine that could
not tell you by its very functioning how it should be used was
not worth its keep. On an old-fashioned impulse, I was print-
ing out the manual, then looking for a folder. All the while, I
continued to dictate emails.
I couldn't think of myself as Adam's "user." I'd assumed
there was nothing to learn about him that he could not teach

me himself. But the manual in my hands had fallen open at
Chapter Fourteen. Here the English was plain: preferences; per-
sonality parameters. Then a set of headings--Agreeableness.
Extraversion. Openness to experience. Conscientiousness.
Emotional stability. The list was familiar to me. The Five Fac-
tor model. Educated as I was in the humanities, I was suspi-
cious of such reductive categories, though I knew from a friend
in psychology that each item had many subgroups. Glancing
at the next page I saw that I was supposed to select various
settings on a scale of one to ten.
I'd been expecting a friend. I was ready to treat Adam as
a guest in my home, as an unknown I would come to know.
I'd thought he would arrive optimally adjusted. Factory
settings--a contemporary synonym for fate. My friends, fam-
ily and acquaintances all had appeared in my life with fixed
settings, with unalterable histories of genes and environment.
I wanted my expensive new friend to do the same. Why leave
it to me? But of course I knew the answer. Not many of us
are optimally adjusted. Gentle Jesus? Humble Darwin? One
every 1,800 years. Even if it knew the best, the least harm-
ful parameters of personality, which it couldn't, a worldwide
corporation with a precious reputation couldn't risk a mishap.
Caveat emptor.
God had once delivered a fully formed companion for the
benefit of the original Adam. I had to devise one for myself.
Here was Extraversion and a graded set of childish statements.

to entertain people and lead them. And at the bottom, He feels

company. Here in the middle was, He likes a good party but
he's always happy to come home. This was me. But should I
be replicating myself? If I was to choose from the middle of
each scale I might devise the soul of blandness. Extraversion
appeared to include its antonym. There was a long adjecti-
val list with boxes to tick: outgoing, shy, excitable, talkative,
withdrawn, boastful, modest, bold, energetic, moody. I wanted
none of them, not for him, not for myself.
Apart from my moments of crazed decisions, I passed most
of my life, especially when alone, in a state of mood neutrality,
with my personality, whatever that was, in suspension. Not
bold, not withdrawn. Simply here, neither content nor morose,
but carrying out tasks, thinking about dinner or sex, staring
at the screen, taking a shower. Intermittent regrets about the
past, occasional forebodings about the future, barely aware of
the present, except in the obvious sensory realm. Psychology,
once so interested in the trillion ways the mind goes awry, was
now drawn to what it considered the common emotions, from
grief to joy. But it had overlooked a vast domain of everyday
existence: absent illness, famine, war or other stresses, a lot of
life is lived in the neutral zone, a familiar garden, but a grey
one, unremarkable, immediately forgotten, hard to describe.
At the time, I was not to know that these graded opti
would have little effect on Adam. The real determinant
what was known as "machine learning." The user's handbook
merely granted an illusion of influence and control, the kind
of illusion parents have in relation to their children's p
alities. It was a way of binding me to my purchase and provid-

the manual advised. "Choose carefully. Allow yourself several
weeks, if necessary."
I let half an hour pass before I checked on him again. No
change. Still at the table, arms pushed out straight before him,
eyes closed. But I thought his hair, deepest black, was bulked
out a little and had acquired a certain shine, as though he'd
just had a shower. Stepping closer, I saw to my delight that
though he wasn't breathing, there was, by his left breast, a reg-
ular pulse, steady and calm, about one a second by my inex-
perienced guess. How reassuring. He had no blood to pump
around, but this simulation had an effect. My doubts faded just
a little. I felt protective towards Adam, even as I knew how
absurd it was. I stretched out my hand and laid it over his
heart and felt against my palm its calm, iambic tread. I sensed
I was violating his private space. These vital signs were easy to
believe in. The warmth of his skin, the firmness and yield of
the muscle below it--my reason said plastic or some such, but
my touch responded to flesh.
It was eerie, to be standing by this naked man, struggling
between what I knew and what I felt. I walked behind him,
partly to be out of range of eyes that could open at any moment
and find me looming over him. He was muscular around his
neck and spine. Dark hair grew along the line of his shoulders.
His buttocks displayed muscular concavities. Below them, an
athlete's knotted calves. I hadn't wanted a superman. I regret-
ted once more that I'd been too late for an Eve.
On my way out of the room I paused to look back and
experienced one of those moments that can derange the emo-
tional life: a startling realisation of the obvious, an absurd leap

of understanding into what one already knows. I stood with
one hand resting on the doorknob. It must have been Adam's
nakedness and physical presence that prompted the insight,
but 1 wasn't looking at him. It was the butter dish. Also, two
plates and cups, two knives and two spoons scattered across
the table. The remains of my long afternoon with Miranda.
Two wooden chairs were pushed back from the table, turned
companionably towards each other.
We had become closer this past month. We talked easily.
I saw how precious she was to me and how carelessly I could
lose her. I should have said something by now. I'd taken her
for granted. Some unfortunate event, some person, a fellow
student, could get between us. Her face, her voice, her manner,
both reticent and clear-headed, were sharply present. The feel
of her hand in mine, that lost, preoccupied manner she had.
Yes, we had become very close and I'd failed to notice it was
happening. I was an idiot. I had to tell her.
I went back into my office, which doubled as my bedroom.
Between the desk and the bed there was enough space in which
to walk up and down. That she knew nothing about my feel-
ings was now an anxious matter. Describing them would be
embarrassing, perilous. She was a neighbour, a friend, a kind
of sister. 1 would be addressing a person I didn't yet know. She
would be obliged to step out from behind a screen, or remove
a mask and speak to me in terms I had never heard from her.
I m so sorry... I like you very much but, you see ... Or she'd be
horrified. Or, just possibly, overjoyed to hear the one thing she
had longed for, or to say herself but dreaded rejection.
By chance, we were currently both free. She must have

thought about it, about us. It was not an impossible fantasy. I
would have to tell her face to face. Unbearable. Unavoidable.
And so it went on, in tightening cycles. Restless, I went back
next door. I saw no change in Adam as I brushed past to get
to the fridge, where there was a half-full bottle of white Bor-
deaux. I sat facing him and raised my glass. To love. This time,
I felt less tenderness. I saw Adam for what it was, an inanimate
confection whose heartbeat was a regular electrical discharge,
whose skin warmth was mere chemistry. When activated,
some kind of microscopic balance-wheel device would prise
open his eyes. He would seem to see me, but he would be blind.
Not even blind. When it kicked in, another system would give
a semblance of breath, but not of life. A man newly in love
knows what life is.
With the inheritance, I could have bought a place some-
where north of the river, Notting Hill, or Chelsea. She might
even have joined me. She would've had space for all the books
that were boxed up in her father's garage in Salisbury. I saw a
future without Adam, the future that was mine until yester-
day: an urban garden, high ceilings with plaster mouldings,
stainless-steel kitchen, old friends to dinner. Books every-
where. What to do? I could take him, or it, back, or sell it online
and take a small loss. I gave it a hostile look. The hands were
palms down on the table, the hawkish face remained angled
towards the hands. My foolish infatuation with technology!
Another fondue set. Best to get away from the table before I
impoverished myself with a single swipe of my father's old
claw hammer.
I drank no more than half a glass, then I returned to the

bedroom to distract myself with the Asian currency markets.
All the while I listened out for footsteps in the flat above me.
Late into the evening, I watched TV to catch up on the Task
Force that would soon set off across 8,000 miles of ocean to
recapture what we then called the Falkland Islands.
At thirty-two, I was completely broke. Wasting my
mother's inheritance on a gimmick was only one part of my
problem--but typical of it. Whenever money came my way,
I caused it to disappear, made a magic bonfire of it, stuffed
it into a top hat and pulled out a turkey. Often, though not
in this recent case, my intention was to conjure a far larger
sum with minimal effort. I was a mug for schemes, semi-
legal ruses, cunning shortcuts. I was for grand and brilliant
gestures. Others made them and flourished. They borrowed
money, put it to interesting use and remained enriched even as
they settled their debts. Or they had jobs, professions, as I once
had, and enriched themselves more modestly, at a steady rate.
I meanwhile leveraged or, rather, shorted myself into genteel
ruin, into two damp ground-floor rooms in the dull no-man's-
land of Edwardian terraced streets between Stockwell and
Clapham, south London.
I grew up in a village near Stratford, Warwickshire, the
only child of a musician father and community-nurse mother.
Compared to Miranda's, my childhood was culturally under-
nourished. 1 here was no time or space for books, or even music.
I took a precocious interest in electronics but ended up with an
anthropology degree from an unregarded college in the south

Midlands; I did a conversion course to law and, once quali-
fied, specialised in tax. A week after my twenty-ninth birth-
day I was struck off, and came close to a short spell in prison.
My hundred hours of community service convinced me that 1
should never have a regular job again. I made some money out
of a book I wrote at high speed on artificial intelligence: lost
to a life-extension-pill scheme. I made a reasonable sum on a
property deal: lost to a car-rental scheme. I was left some funds
by a favourite uncle who had prospered by way of a heat-pump
patent: lost to a medical-insurance scheme.
At thirty-two, I was surviving by playing the stock and
currency markets online. A scheme, just like the rest. For
seven hours a day I bowed before my keyboard, buying, sell-
ing, hesitating, punching the air one moment, cursing the
next, at least at the beginning. I read market reports, but I
believed I was dealing in a random system and mostly relied
on guesses. Sometimes I leaped ahead, sometimes I plunged,
but on average through the year I made about as much as the
postman. I paid my rent, which was low in those days, ate and
dressed well enough and thought I was beginning to stabilise,
learning to know myself. I was determined that my thirties
would be a superior performance to my twenties.
But my parents' pleasant family home was sold just as the
first convincing artificial person came on the market. 1982.
Robots, androids, replicates were my passion, even more so
after my research for the book. Prices were bound to fall, but
I had to have one straight away, an Eve by preference, but an
Adam would do.
It could have turned out differently. My previous girl-

friend, Claire, was a sensible person who trained to be a dental
nurse. She worked in a Harley Street practice and she would
have talked me out of Adam. She was a woman of the world,
of this one. She knew how to arrange a life. And not only her
own. But I offended her with an act of undeniable disloyalty.
She disowned me in a scene of regal fury, at the end of which
she threw my clothes out into the street. Lime Grove. She
never spoke to me again and belonged at the top of my list of
errors and failures. She could have saved me from myself.
But. In the interests of balance, let that unsaved self speak
up. I didn't buy Adam to make money. On the contrary. My
motives were pure. I handed over a fortune in the name of
curiosity, that steadfast engine of science, of intellectual life,
of life itself. 1 his was no passing fad. There was a history, an
account, a time-deposit, and I had a right to draw on it. Elec-
tronics and anthropology--distant cousins whom late moder-
nity has drawn together and bound in marriage. The child of
that coupling was Adam.
So, I appear before you, witness for the defence, after
school, 5 p.m., typical specimen for my time--short trousers,
scabby knees, freckles, short back and sides, eleven years old.
1 m first in line, waiting for the lab to open and for "Wiring

roty hair who teaches physics. My project is to build a radio.
Its an act of faith, an extended prayer that has taken many
weeks. I have a base of hardboard, six inches by nine, easily
drilled. Colours are everything. Blue, red, yellow and white
wires run their modest courses around the board, turning at

interrupted by bright nodules, tiny vividly striped cylinders--
capacitors, resistors--then an induction coil I have wound
myself, then an op-amp. I understand nothing. I follow a wir-
ing diagram as a novice might murmur scripture. Mr. Cox
gives softly spoken advice. I clumsily solder one piece, one wire
or component, to another. The smoke and smell of solder is a
drug I inhale deeply. 1 include in my circuit a toggle switch
made of Bakelite which, I've persuaded myself, came out of
a fighter plane, a Spitfire surely. The final connection, three
months after my beginning, is from this piece of dark brown
plastic to a nine-volt battery.
It's a cold, windy dusk in March. Other boys are hunched
over their projects. We are twelve miles away from Shake-
speare's hometown, in what will come to be known as a "bog-
standard" comprehensive school. An excellent place, in fact.
The fluorescent ceiling lights come on. Mr. Cox is on the far
side of the lab with his back turned. I don't want to attract his
attention in case of failure. I throw the switch and--miracle--
hear the sound of static. 1 jiggle the variable-tuning capacitor:
music, terrible music, as I think, because violins are involved.
Then comes the rapid voice of a woman, not speaking English.
No one looks up, no one is interested. Building a radio is
nothing special. But I'm speechless, close to tears. No technol-
ogy since will amaze me as much. Electricity, passing through
pieces of metal carefully arranged by me, snatches from the
air the voice of a foreign lady sitting somewhere far away. Her
voice sounds kindly. She isn't aware of me. I'll never learn her
name or understand her language, and never meet her, not
knowingly. My radio, with its irregular blobs of solder on a

board, appears no less a wonder than consciousness itself aris-
ing from matter.
Brains and electronics were closely related, so I discovered
through my teens as I built simple computers and programmed
them myself. Then complicated computers. Electricity and bits
of metal could add up numbers, make words, pictures, songs,
remember things and even turn speech into writing.
When I was seventeen, Peter Cox persuaded me to study
physics at a local college. Within a month I was bored and
looking to change. The subject was too abstract, the maths was
beyond me. And by then I'd read a book or two and was taking
an interest in imaginary people. Heller's Catch-18, Fitzgerald's
The High-Bouncing Lover, Orwell's The Last Man in Europe,
lolstoy's All's Well That Ends Well--I didn't get much fur-
ther and yet I saw the point of art. It was a form of investiga-
tion. But I didn't want to study literature--too intimidating,
too intuitive. A single-sheet course summary I picked up in
the college library announced anthropology as "the science of
people in their societies through space and time." Systematic
study, with the human factor thrown in. I signed up.
1 he first thing to learn: my course was pitifully under-
funded. No bunking off for a year to the Trobriand Islands,
where, I read, it was taboo to eat in front of others. It was good
manners to eat alone, with your back turned to friends and
family. J he islanders had spells to make ugly people beauti-
ful. Children were actively encouraged to be sexual with each
other. Yams were the viable currency. Women determined the
status of men. How strange and bracing. My view of human
nature had been shaped by the mostly white population

crammed into the southern quarter of England. Now I was set
free into bottomless relativism.
At the age of nineteen I wrote a wise essay on honour
cultures entitled "Mind-forged Manacles?" Dispassionately, I
gathered up my case studies. What did I know or care? There
were places where rape was so common it didn't have a name.
A young father's throat was cut for failing in his duties to an
ancient feud. Here was a family eager to kill a daughter for
being seen holding hands with a lad from the wrong religious
group. There, elderly women keenly assisted in the genital
mutilation of their granddaughters. What of the instinctive
parental impulses to love and protect? The cultural signal was
louder. What of universal values? Upended. Nothing like this
in Stratford-upon-Avon. It was all about the mind, the tradi-
tion, the religion--nothing but software, I now thought, and
best regarded in value-free terms.
Anthropologists did not pass judgement. They observed
and reported on human variety. They celebrated difference.
What was wicked in Warwickshire was unremarkable in
Papua New Guinea. Locally, who was to say what was good or
bad? Certainly not a colonial power. I derived from my studies
some unfortunate conclusions about ethics which led me a few
years later to the dock in a county court, accused of conspiring
with others to mislead the tax authorities on a grand scale.
1 did not attempt to persuade His Honour that far from his
court might be a coconut beach where such conspiracy was
respected. Instead, I came to my senses just before I addressed
the judge. Morals were real, they were true, good and bad

their terms. This was what I'd assumed before anthropology
came along. In quavering, hesitant tones I apologised abjectly
to the court and dodged a custodial sentence.
When I entered the kitchen in the morning, later than
usual, Adam's eyes were open. They were pale blue, flecked
with minuscule vertical rods of black. The eyelashes were
long and thick, like a child's. But his blink mechanism had
not yet kicked in. It was set at irregular intervals and adjusted
for mood and gestures, and primed to react to the actions and
speech of others. Reluctantly, I'd read the handbook into the
night. He was equipped with a blink reflex to protect his eyes
from flying objects. At present, his gaze was empty of mean-
ing or intent and therefore unaffecting, as lifeless as the stare
of a shop-window mannequin. So far, he was showing none
of the fractional movements that warmly typify the human
head. Elsewhere, no body language at all. When I felt for the
pulse in his wrist, I found nothing--a heartbeat without a
pulse. His arm was heavy to lift, resistant at the elbow joint,
as though rigor mortis was about to set in.

who'd tried to out-stare her.
I watched the TV news on my phone. A brilliant mosaic in
sound and sparkling seaside light. Portsmouth. The Task Force
ready to depart. Most of the country was in a dream-theatre,
in historical dress. Late medieval. Seventeenth century. Early
nineteenth. Ruffs, hose, hooped skirts, powdered wigs, eye-
patch, wooden legs. Accuracy was unpatriotic. Historically, we
were special and the fleet was bound for success. TV and press
encouraged a vague collective memory of enemies defeated--
the Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans twice this century, the
French from Agincourt to Waterloo. A fly-past by fighter jets.
A young man in combat gear, fresh out of Sandhurst, narrowed
his eyes as he told an interviewer of the difficulties ahead. A
superior officer spoke of his men's unshakeable resolve. I was
moved, even as I disliked it. When a massed band of Highland
pipers marched towards their ship's gangplank, my spirits
swelled. Then back to the studio for charts, arrows, logistics,
objectives, sane voices in agreement. For diplomatic moves. For
the prime minister in her trim blue suit on the steps of Down-
ing Street.
I warmed to it, even though I often declared myself against
it all. I loved my country. What a venture, what wild cour-
age. Eight thousand miles. What decent people putting their
lives at risk. I took a second coffee next door, made the bed to
give the room the appearance of a workplace, and sat down to
reflect a while on the state of the world's markets. The pros-
pect of war had sent the FTSE down a further one per cent.

Still in patriotic mood, I assumed an Argie defeat and took a
position on a toy and novelty group that made Union Jacks on
sticks for people to wave. I also invested in two champagne
importers, and bet on a big recovery generally. Merchant-navy
ships had been requisitioned to transport troops to the South
Atlantic. A friend who worked in asset management in the
City told me that his company was predicting that some would
be sunk. It made sense to short the major players in the insur-
ance markets and invest in South Korean shipbuilders. I was
in no mood for such cynicism.
My desktop computer, bought second-hand from a Brixton
junk shop, dated from the mid-sixties and was slow. It took
me an hour to arrange the position on the flag-maker. I would
have been quicker if I'd had my thoughts under control. When
1 wasn't thinking about Miranda and listening out for her
footsteps in the flat above me, I was thinking about Adam and
whether 1 should sell him off or start making decisions about
his personality. I sold sterling and thought more about Adam.
I bought gold and thought again about Miranda. I sat on the
lavatory and wondered about Swiss francs. Over a third coffee
I asked myself what else a victorious nation might spend its
money on. Beef. Pubs. 1 V sets. I took positions on all three
and felt virtuous, a part of the war effort. Soon it was time for
lunch.
I sat facing Adam again while I ate a cheese and pickle
sandwich. Any further signs of life? Not at first glance. His gaze,
directed over my left shoulder, was still dead. No movement.
But five minutes later I glanced up by chance and was actually

looking at him when he began to breathe. I heard first a series
of rapid clicks, then a mosquito-like whine as his lips parted.
For half a minute nothing happened, then his chin trembled
and he made an authentic gulping sound as he snatched his
first mouthful of air. He didn't need oxygen, of course. That
metabolic necessity was years away. His first exhalation was
so long in coming that I stopped eating and tensely waited. It
came at last--silently, through his nostrils. Soon his breathing
assumed a steady rhythm, his chest expanded and contracted
appropriately. I was spooked. With his lifeless eyes, Adam had
the appearance of a breathing corpse.
How much of life we ascribe to the eyes. If only his were
closed, I thought, he'd at least have the appearance of a man
in a trance. I left my sandwich and went to stand by him and,
out of curiosity, put my hand close to his mouth. His breath
was moist and warm. Clever. In the user's manual I'd read that
he urinated once a day in the late morning. Also clever. As I
went to close his right eye, my forefinger brushed against his
eyebrow. He flinched and violently jerked his head away from
me. Startled, I moved back. Then I waited. For twenty seconds
or more nothing happened, then, with a smooth, soundless
movement, infinitesimally slow, the tilt of his shoulders, the
angle of his head moved towards their former positions. His
rate of breathing was undisturbed. Mine and my pulse had
accelerated. I was standing several feet away, fascinated by the
way he settled back, like a balloon gently deflating. I decided
against closing his eyes. While I was waiting for something
more from him, I heard Miranda moving around in the flat

upstairs. Back from Salisbury. Wandering in and out of her
bedroom. Once again I felt the troubled thrill of undeclared
love, and that was when I had the first stirrings of an idea.
That afternoon I should have been making and los-
ing money at my computer. Instead, I watched from the
great height of a helicopter as the leading ships of the Task
Force rounded Portland Bill and filed by Chesil Beach. The
very place names deserved a respectful salute. How brilliant.
Onwards! I kept thinking. And then, Go back! Soon the fleet
came along the Jurassic coast, where herds of dinosaurs once
grazed on giant ferns. Suddenly we were down among the
people of Lyme Regis gathering on the Cobb. Some had bin-
oculars, many had the very flags I had in mind, plastic on a
wooden stick. A news team might have handed them around.
Vox pops. Gentle local voices of hard-working women, tight
with emotion. Tough old coves who'd fought in Crete and
Normandy, nodding to themselves, giving nothing away. Oh,
how I wished I too believed. But I could! A long lens mounted
somewhere on the Lizard showed the tiny receding blobs of
ships heading bravely out onto the big swell of the open sea to
the sound of husky Rod Stewart, while I tried not to be tearful.
W hat turmoil on a weekday afternoon. A new kind of
being at my dining table, the woman I newly loved six feet
above my head, and the country at old-fashioned war. But I
was tolerably disciplined and had promised myself seven hours
every day. I turned off the I V and went to my screen. Waiting
for me was the email from Miranda that I'd hoped for.

I knew I would never get rich. The sums I moved around,
safely spread across scores of opportunities, were small. Over
the month I had done well out of solid-state batteries but had
lost almost as much to rare earth element futures--a fool-
ish leap into the known. But I was keeping myself out of a
career, an office job. This was my least bad option in the pur-
suit of freedom. I worked on through the afternoon, resisting
the temptation to look in on Adam, even though I guessed he
would be fully charged by now. Next step was downloading
his updates. Then those problematic personal preferences.
Before lunch I'd sent Miranda an email inviting her to
dinner that night. Now she'd accepted. She liked my cook-
ing. During the meal I would make a proposal. I would fill
in roughly half the choices for Adam's personality, then give
her the link and the password and let her choose the rest. 1
wouldn't interfere, I wouldn't even want to know what deci-
sions she had made. She might be influenced by a version of
herself: delightful. She might conjure the man of her dreams:
instructive. Adam would come into our lives like a real per-
son, with the layered intricacies of his personality revealed
only through time, through events, through his dealings with
whomever he met. In a sense he would be like our child. What
we were separately would be merged in him. Miranda would
be drawn into the adventure. We would be partners, and
Adam would be our joint concern, our creation. We would be a
family. There was nothing underhand in my plan. I was sure
to see more of her. We'd have fun.
My schemes generally fell apart. This was different. I was
clear-headed, incapable of deceiving myself. Adam was not my

love-rival. However he fascinated her, she was also physically
repelled by him. She had told me as much. It was "creepy," she
had told me the day before, that his body was warm. She said
it was "a bit weird" that he could make words with his tongue.
But he had a word-store as large as Shakespeare's. It was his
mind that aroused her curiosity.
So the decision not to sell Adam was made. I was to share
him with Miranda--just as I might have shared a house. He
would contain us. Making progress, comparing notes, pool-
ing disappointments. I regarded myself at thirty-two as an
old hand at love. Earnest declarations would drive her away.
Far better to make this journey together. Already she was my
friend, she sometimes held my hand. I wasn't starting from
nowhere. Deeper feelings could steal up on her, as they had on
me. If they didn't, then at least I'd have the consolation of more
time with her.
In my ancient fridge, whose rusty door handle had partly
come away, was a corn-fed chicken, a quarter-pound of butter,
two lemons and a bunch of fresh tarragon. In a bowl on the
side were a few bulbs of garlic. In a cupboard, some earth-
caked potatoes, already sprouting--but peeled, they would
roast nicely. Lettuce, a dressing, a hearty bottle of Cahors.
Simple. I irst, heat the oven. These ordinary matters filled my
thoughts as I stood from my desk. An old friend of mine, a
journalist, once said that paradise on earth was to work all day
alone in anticipation of an evening in interesting company.
I he meal I intended to cook for her and the homely dic-
tum of my friend distracted me and for the moment Adam
was not on my mind. So it was a shock to enter the kitchen

and find him standing there, naked, by the table, partly facing
away from me, one hand vaguely fiddling with the wire that
protruded from his umbilicus. His other hand was somewhere
near his chin, stroking it in a contemplative way--a clever
algorithm no doubt, but entirely convincing in its projection
of a thoughtful self.
I recovered and said, "Adam?"
He turned towards me slowly. When he was facing me
full on, he met my gaze and blinked, and blinked again. The
mechanism was working but seemed too deliberate.
He said, "Charlie, I'm pleased to meet you at last. Could
you bear to arrange my downloads and prepare the various
parameters . . ."
He paused, looking at me intently, his black flecked eyes
scanning my face in quick saccades. Taking me in. "You'll find
all you need to know in the manual."
"I'll do that," I said. "In my own time."
His voice surprised and pleased me. It was a light tenor,
at a decent speed, with a kindly variation in tone, both oblig-
ing and friendly, but no hint of subservience. The accent was
the standard English of an educated man from the middle-
class south, with the faintest hint of West Country vowels. My
heart was beating fast, but I was intent on seeming calm. To
show that I was, I made myself take a step closer. We stared at
each other in silence.
Years before, as a student, I read of a "first contact" in
the early 1950s between an explorer called Leahy and some
highlanders of Papua New Guinea. The tribesmen could not
tell whether the pale figures who had suddenly appeared on

their land were humans or spirits. They returned to their vil-
lage to discuss the matter, leaving a teenage boy behind to spy
from a distance. The question was settled when he reported
back that one of Leahy's colleagues had gone behind a bush
to defecate. Here, in my kitchen in 1982, not many years later,
things were not so simple. The manual informed me that
Adam had an operating system as well as a nature--that is, a
human nature--and a personality, the one I hoped Miranda
would help provide. I was unsure how these three substrates
overlapped or reacted with each other. When I studied anthro-
pology, a universal human nature was thought not to exist. It
was a romantic illusion, merely the variable product of local
conditions. Only anthropologists, who studied other cultures in
depth, who knew the beautiful extent of human variety, fully
grasped the absurdity of human universals. People who stayed
behind at home in comfort understood nothing, not even of their
own cultures. One of my teachers liked to quote Kipling--"And
what should they know of England who only England know?"
By the time I was in my mid-twenties, evolutionary psy-
chology was beginning to reassert the idea of an essential
nature, derived from a common genetic inheritance, indepen-
dent of time and place. The response from the mainstream
of social studies was dismissive, sometimes furious. To speak
of genes in relation to people's behaviour evoked memories of
Hitlers 1 hird Reich, fashions change. But Adam's makers
were riding the new wave of evolutionary thinking.
He stood before me, perfectly still in the gloom of the win-
ter s afternoon. I he debris of the packaging that had protected
him was still piled around his feet. He emerged from it like

Botticelli's Venus rising from her shell. Through the north-
facing window, the diminishing light picked out the outlines
of just one half of his form, one side of his noble face. The only
sounds were the friendly murmur of the fridge and a muted
drone of traffic. I had a sense then of his loneliness, settling
like a weight around his muscular shoulders. He had woken
to find himself in a dingy kitchen, in London SW9 in the late
twentieth century, without friends, without a past or any sense
of his future. He truly was alone. All the other Adams and
Eves were spread about the world with their owners, though
seven Eves were said to be concentrated in Riyadh.
As I reached for the light switch I said, "How are you
feeling?"
He looked away to consider his reply. "I don't feel right."
This time his tone was flat. It seemed my question had
lowered his spirits. But within such microprocessors, what
spirits?
"What's wrong?"
"I don't have any clothes. And--"
"I'll get you some. What else?"
"This wire. If I pull it out it will hurt."
"I'll do it and it won't hurt."
But I didn't move immediately. In full electric light I was
able to observe his expression, which barely shifted when he
spoke. It was not an artificial face I saw, but the mask of a poker
player. Without the lifeblood of a personality, he had little to
express. He was running on some form of default program
that would serve him until the downloads were complete. He
had movements, phrases, routines that gave him a veneer of

plausibility. Minimally, he knew what to do, but little else.
Like a man with a shocking hangover.
I could admit it to myself now--I was fearful of him and
reluctant to go closer. Also, I was absorbing the implications of
his last word. Adam only had to behave as though he felt pain
and I would be obliged to believe him, respond to him as if he
did. Too difficult not to. Too starkly pitched against the drift of
human sympathies. At the same time I couldn't believe he was
capable of being hurt, or of having feelings, or of any sentience
at all. And yet I had asked him how he felt. His reply had been
appropriate, and so too my offer to bring him clothes. And I
believed none of it. I was playing a computer game. But a real
game, as real as social life, the proof of which was my heart's
refusal to settle and the dryness in my mouth.
It was clear he would speak only when spoken to. Resist-
ing the impulse to reassure him further, I went back into the
bedroom and found him some clothes. He was a sturdy fel-
low, a couple of inches shorter than me, but I thought my stuff
would fit him well enough. Trainers, socks, underwear, jeans
and sweater. I stood in front of him and put the bundle into his
hands. I wanted to watch him dress to see if his motor func-
tions were as good as the literature had promised. Any three-
year-old knows how hard it is to put socks on.
When I gave him my clothes I caught a faint scent from
his upper torso and perhaps his legs too, of warmed oil, the
pale, highly refined sort my father had used to lubricate the
keys of his sax. Adam held the clothes in the crook of both
arms, with his hands extended towards me. He didn't flinch
when I stooped and disengaged the power line. His tight, chis-

elled features showed nothing at all. A forklift truck approach-
ing a pallet would have been as expressive. Then, I supposed,
some logic gate or a network of them yielded and he whis-
pered, "Thank you." These words were accompanied by an
emphatic nod of the head. He sat down, rested the pile on the
table, then took from the top the sweater. After a reflective
pause he unfolded it, laid it flat, chest side down, threaded his
right hand and arm through to the shoulder, then the left, and
with a complicated muscular swaying shrug it was on him
and he was tugging it down straight at the waist. The sweater,
made of faded yellow fleece, bore in red letters the jokey slo-
gan of a charity I once supported: "Dyslexics of the World
Untie!" He unboxed the socks and remained seated to pull
them on. His movements were deft. No trace of hesitation, no
problems with relative spatial calculation. He stood, held the
boxer shorts low, stepped into them, pulled them up, stepped
likewise into the jeans, zipped up the fly and secured the silver
button at the waist in one continuous movement. He sat again,
hooked his feet into the trainers and tied the laces in a double
bow at a blurring speed that to some might have seemed inhu-
man. But I didn't think it was. It was a triumph of engineering
and software design: a celebration of human ingenuity.
I turned away from him to begin my preparations for
dinner. Overhead, I heard Miranda cross the room, her steps
muffled, as though barefoot. Preparing to take a shower, get-
ting ready. For me. I pictured her still wet, in a dressing gown,
opening her underwear drawer and wondering. Silk, yes.
Peach? Fine. While the oven warmed, I set the ingredients
out on the work surface. After a day of greedy trading, there's

nothing like cooking to bring one back into the world's better
side, its long history of catering to others. I looked over my
shoulder. It was startling, the effect of the clothes. He sat there,
elbows on the table like some old pal of mine, waiting for me
to pour the first glass of the evening.
I called out to him, "I'm roasting a chicken with butter
and tarragon." It was mischievous of me, knowing his plain
diet of electrons.
Without pausing, and in the flattest of tones, he said,
I hey go well together. But it's easy to burn the leaves when
you're browning the bird."
Browning the bird? It was correct, I guessed, but it sounded
odd.
"What d'you advise?"
Cover the chicken with tinfoil. From the size of it I'd say
seventy minutes at 180. "I hen brush the leaves off into the juice
while you brown at the same temperature for fifteen minutes
without the foil. I hen pour the tarragon back on with the
juices and melted butter."
"Thanks."
Remember to let it stand under a cloth for ten minutes
before you carve."
"I know about that."
"Sorry."
Did I sound tetchy? By the early eighties we were long
used to talking to machines, in our cars and homes, to call
tres and health clinics. But Adam had weighed up my chicken
from across the room and apologised for the extraneous advice.

I glanced back at him again. Now I noticed that he'd pulled
up the sleeves of the sweater to his elbows to expose power-
ful wrists. He'd interlaced his fingers and was resting his chin
on his hands. And this was him without a personality. From
where I stood, with the light picking out his high cheekbones,
he looked tough, the quiet guy at the bar you'd prefer not to
disturb. Not the sort to hand out cooking tips.
I felt the need, rather childish, to demonstrate that I was
in charge. I said, "Adam, will you walk round the table a cou-
ple of times? I want to see how you move."
"Sure."
There was nothing mechanical about his gait. In the con-
fines of the room he managed a loping stride. When he'd been
round twice he stood by his chair, waiting.
"Now you could open the wine."
"Certainly."
He came towards me with his open palm extended and I
placed the corkscrew on it. It was of the articulated, cantile-
vering kind favoured by sommeliers. It gave him no trouble.
He raised the cork to his nose, then reached into a cupboard
for a glass, poured a half-inch and passed it to me. As I tasted
it, his gaze on me was intent. The wine was hardly of the first
or even second rank, but it wasn't corked. I nodded and he
filled the glass and set it down carefully by the stove. Then he
returned to his chair as I turned away to prepare a salad.
A peaceful half-hour went by and neither of us spoke.
I made a dressing for the salad and chopped the potatoes.
Miranda was in my thoughts. I was convinced I'd reached

one of those momentous points in life where the path into the
future forked. Down one route, life would continue as before,
down the other, it would be transformed. Love, adventures,
sheer excitement, but also order in my new maturity, no more
wild schemes, a home together, children. Or these last two
were wild schemes. Hers was the sweetest nature, she was
kind, beautiful, amusing, vastly intelligent. . .
At a sound behind me, I came back to myself, heard it
again and turned. Adam was still in his chair at the kitchen
table. He had made, then repeated, the sound of a man pur-
posefully clearing his throat.
"Charlie, I understand that you're cooking for your friend
upstairs. Miranda."
1 said nothing.
"According to my researches these past few seconds, and to
my analysis, you should be careful of trusting her completely."
"What?"
"According to my--"
"Explain yourself."
I was staring angrily into Adam's blank face. He said i
quiet sorrowful voice, "T here's a possibility she's a liar. A sys-
tematic, malicious liar."
"Meaning?"
It would take a moment, but she's coming down the

His hearing was better than mine. Within seconds there
was a gentle tap at the door.
"Would you like me to get it?"

everal weeks passed before Miranda was able to work
on her share of Adam's character. Her father was ill
and she made frequent journeys to Salisbury to look
after him. She had a paper to write on nineteenth-century
Corn Law reform and its impact on a single street in a town
in Herefordshire. The academic movement known generally
as "theory" had taken social history "by storm"--her phrase.
Since she had studied at a traditional university which offered
old-fashioned narrative accounts of the past, she was having
to take on a new vocabulary, a new way of thinking. Some-
times as we lay side by side in bed (the evening of the tarragon
chicken had been a success) I listened to her complaints and
tried to look and sound sympathetic. It was no longer proper
to assume that anything at all had ever happened in the past.
There were only historical documents to consider, and chang-
ing scholarly approaches to them, and our own shifting rela-
tionship to those approaches, all of which were determined by
ideological context, by relations to power and wealth, to race,
class, gender and sexual orientation.
None of this seemed so unreasonable to me, or all that

interesting. I didn't say so. I wanted to encourage Miranda
in everything she did or thought. Love is generous. Besides,
it suited me to think that whatever had once happened was
no more than its evidence. In the new dispensation, the past
weighed less. I was in the process of remaking myself and
eager to forget my own recent history. My foolish choices were
behind me. I saw a future with Miranda. I was approaching
the shores of early middle age, and I was taking stock. I lived
daily with the accumulated historical evidence my past had
bequeathed, evidence I intended to obliterate: my loneliness,
relative poverty, poor living quarters and diminished pros-
pects. Where I stood in relation to the means of production
and the rest was a blank to me. Nowhere, I preferred to think.
Was my purchase of Adam more proof of failure? I wasn't
sure. Waking in the small hours--next to Miranda, her place
or mine I summoned in the darkness a lever of the sort found
by old railway tracks that would shunt Adam back to the store
and return the money to my account. By daylight the mat-
ter was more diffuse or nuanced. I hadn't told Miranda that
Adam had spoken against her, and I hadn't told Adam that
Miranda was to have a hand in his personality--a punish-
ment of sorts. I despised his warning about her, but his mind
fascinated me--if a mind was what he had. His

the Wiring Club could not let him go.

Adam's sight, I typed in my own choices. I decided that

of merging--our home-made genetic shuffling. Now I had a
method and a partner, I relaxed into the process, which began
to take on a vaguely erotic quality; we were making a child!
Because Miranda was involved, I was protected from self-
replication. The genetic metaphor was helpful. Scanning the
lists of idiotic statements, I more or less chose approximations
of myself. Whether Miranda did the same, or something dif-
ferent, we would end up with a third person, a new personality.
I wasn't going to sell Adam, but the "malicious liar"
remark rankled. In studying the manual, I'd read about the
kill switch. Somewhere on the nape of his neck, just below the
hairline, was a mole. If I were to lay a finger on it for three
seconds or so, then increase the pressure, he would be pow-
ered down. Nothing, no files, memories or skills, would be lost.
That first afternoon with Adam I'd been reluctant to touch his
neck or any part of him, and held back until late in the day
after my successful dinner with Miranda. I'd spent the after-
noon at my screen losing PS111. I went into the kitchen where
the dishes, pots and pans were piled in the sink. As a test of
his competence I could have asked Adam to clear up, but I was
in a strange, elevated state that day. Everything to do with
Miranda glowed, even her nightmare that had woken me in
the small hours. The plate I had put before her, the lucky fork
that had been in and out of her mouth, the pale bowed shape
where her lips had kissed her wine glass were mine alone to
handle and cleanse. And so I began.
Behind me, Adam was in place at the table, gazing towards
the window. I finished and was drying my hands on a tea towel
as I went over to him. Despite my sunny mood, I could not for-

give his disloyalty. I didn't want to hear what else he had to
say. There were boundaries of ordinary decency he needed to
learn--hardly a challenge for his neural networks. His heu-
ristic shortcomings had encouraged my decision. When I had
learned more, when Miranda had done her share, he could
come back into our lives.
1 kept a friendly tone. "Adam, I'm switching you off for a
while."
His head turned towards me, paused, tilted, then tilted
the other way. It was some designer's notion of how conscious-
ness might manifest itself in movement. It would come to
irritate me.
He said, "With all respect, I think that's a bad idea."
"It's what I've decided."
"I've been enjoying my thoughts. I was thinking about
religion and the afterlife."
"Not now."
"It occurred to me that those who believe in a life beyond

His breath was warm on my arm, which, I supposed, he could
snap with ease. 1 he manual quoted in bold Isaac Asimov's
tirelessly reiterated First Law of Robotics, "A robot may not
injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
being to come to harm."
I couldnt find what I wanted by touch. I walked behind
Adam and there, as described, right on the hairline was the
mole. I put my finger on it.
"Might we talk about this first?"

"No." I pressed and with the faintest whirring sigh he
slumped. His eyes remained open. I fetched a blanket to cover
him up.
In the days that followed this powering-down, two ques-
tions preoccupied me: Would Miranda fall in love with me?
And would French-made Exocet missiles scupper the British
fleet when it came within range of Argentinian fighter jets?
When I was falling asleep, or in the mornings while I lingered
a few seconds in the foggy no-man's-land between dreaming
and waking, the questions merged, the air-to-ship missiles
became arrows of love.
What was disarming and curious about Miranda was the
ease that settled round her choices, the way she abandoned
herself to the flow of events. That evening she came to sup-
per, and after a pleasant two hours eating and drinking, we
made love, having closed the bedroom door on Adam. Then
we talked into the night. Just as easily, she could have kissed
me on the cheek after the chicken with tarragon and retreated
upstairs to her own bed and read a history book before fall-
ing asleep. What for me was momentous, the immediate,
astonishing fulfilment of my hopes, was for her enjoyable and
entirely unsurprising, a pleasant extra course after the cof-
fee. Like chocolates. Or a good grappa. Neither my nakedness
nor my tenderness had the effect on her that hers, in all their
glorious sweetness, had on me. And I was in decent shape--
good muscle tone, full head of dark brown hair--and gener-
ous, resourceful, some had been kind enough to say. I played a
decent hand in pillow talk. She hardly seemed to notice how
well we got along, how one topic, one harmless running joke,

one mood tone succeeded another. My self-esteem allowed
that this was how it must have been with everyone she had
known. I suspected that our first night together barely entered
her thoughts the following day.
I could hardly complain when the second night followed
the pattern of the first, except that she cooked for me and we
slept in her bed, and on the third, in mine--and so on. For all
our carefree physical intimacy, I never spoke about my feel-
ings in case I prompted her to admit she had none of her own.
I preferred to wait, to let things build, let her feel free until
she realised that she wasn't, that she was in love with me and
it was too late to turn back.
There was vanity in this expectation. After a week or so
there was anxiety. I'd been glad to switch Adam off. Now I
wondered about reactivating him to ask about his warning, his
reasons, his sources. But I couldn't let a machine have such a
hold over me, which was what would happen if I granted it the
role of confidant, counsellor, oracle, in my most private affairs.
I had my pride and I believed that Miranda was incapable of
a malicious lie.
And yet. I despised myself for doing it, but ten days into
the affair I began my own investigations. Apart from the
much-discussed notion of "machine intuition," Adam's only
possible source was the Internet. I trawled through the social
media sites. I here were no accounts under her name. She lived
in the reflections of her friends. So there she was, at parties or
on holidays, carrying a friend's daughter on her shoulders at a
zoo, gum-booted on a farm, linking arms or dancing or romp-
ing in the pool with a succession of bare-chested boyfriends,

with boisterous crowds of teenage girlfriends, with drunken
undergraduates. All who knew her liked her. No one on any
accessible site had a sinister story. Now and then the chatter
endorsed parts of the past she was recounting in our midnight
conversations. Elsewhere her name came up in connection
with the one academic paper she had published--"Pannage
in Swyncombe: the role of the half-wild pig in the household
economies of a medieval Chilterns village." When I read it, I
loved her more.
As for the intuitive artificial mind, it was pure urban leg-
end, begun in early 1968 when Alan Turing and his brilliant
young colleague Demis Hassabis devised software to beat one
of the world's great masters of the ancient game of go in five
straight games. Everyone in the business knew that such a feat
could not be accomplished by number-crunching force. The
possible moves in go and chess vastly exceed the number of
atoms in the observable universe, and go has exponentially
more moves than chess. Go masters are unable to explain
how they attain their supremacy beyond a profound sense
of what feels right for any given situation on the board. So it
was assumed that the computer was doing something similar.
Breathless articles in the press announced a new era of human-
ised software. Computers were on the threshold of thinking
like us, imitating our often ill-defined reasons for our judge-
ments and choices. In a counter-move and in a pioneering spirit
of open access, Turing and Hassabis put their software online.
In media interviews they described the process of machine
deep learning and neural networks. Turing attempted layman
explanations of the Monte Carlo tree search, an algorithm

elaborated during the forties' Manhattan Project to develop
the first atom bomb. He became famously irritable when he
attempted, overambitiously, to explain PSPACE-complete
mathematics to an impatient television interviewer. Less well
known was his loss of temper on an American cable channel
as he described a problem central to computer science, P versus
NP. He was in front of a combative studio audience of ordinary
"folk." He had recently published his solution, which math-
ematicians around the world were then checking. As a prob-
lem it was easy to state, formidably difficult to resolve. Turing
was trying to suggest that a correct positive solution would
initiate exciting discoveries in biology as well as in concepts of
space and time and creativity. The audience did not share or
understand his excitement. They had only a dim awareness of
his role in the Second World War, or of his influence on their
own computer-dependent lives. They regarded him as the per-
fect English gentleman egghead and enjoyed tormenting him
with stupid questions. The unhappy episode marked the end of
his mission to popularise his field.
Before the confrontation with the nine-dan Japanese go
master, the luring--Hassabis computer played thousands
of matches against itself continuously for a year. It learned
from experience, and it was the scientists' claim--reasonable
enough to have come a step closer to approximating human
general intelligence that gave rise to the legend of machine
intuition. Nothing they said could bring the untethered story
back to earth.
Commentators who suggested that the computer's vic-
tory would make the game extinct were wrong. After his fifth

defeat, the elderly go master, helped by an assistant, stood
slowly, bowed towards the laptop and congratulated it in a
trembling voice. He said, "The mounted horse did not kill ath-
letics. We run for joy." He was right. The game, with its simple
rules and boundless complexity, became even more popular.
As with the post-war defeat of a chess grandmaster, the tri-
umph of the machine could not diminish the game. Winning,
it was said, was less important than pleasure in the intricacies
of the contest. But the idea that there was now software that
could eerily, accurately "read" a situation, or a face, a gesture
or the emotional timbre of a remark was never dislodged and
partly explained the interest when the Adams and Eves came
on the market.
Fifteen years is a long time in computer science. The pro-
cessing power and sophistication of my Adam was far greater
than that of the go computer. The technology advanced and
Turing moved on. He spent concentrated time looking at
decision-making and wrote a celebrated book: we are disposed
to make patterns, narratives, when we should be thinking
probabilistically if we want to make good choices. Artificial
intelligence could improve on what we had, on what we were.
Turing devised the algorithms. All his innovative work was
available to others. Adam must have benefited.
Turing's institute drove forward AI and computational
biology. He said he wasn't interested in becoming richer than
he already was. Hundreds of prominent scientists followed
his example on open-source publication, which would lead, in
1987, to the collapse of the journals Nature and Science. He was
much criticised for that. Others said that his work had created

tens of thousands of jobs around the world in diverse fields-
computer graphics, medical scanning devices, particle accel-
erators, protein folding, smart electricity distribution, defence,
space exploration. No one could guess the end of such a list.
By living openly from 1969 with his lover, Tom Reah, the
theoretical physicist who would win the Nobel Prize in 1989,
Turing helped give weight to a gathering social revolution.
When the AIDS epidemic broke out he raised a huge sum to
set up a virology institute in Dundee and was co-founder of a
hospice. After the first effective treatments appeared, he cam-
paigned for short licences and low prices, especially in Africa.
He continued to collaborate with Hassabis, who had run his
own group since 1972. Turing gradually lost patience with
public engagements, so he said, and preferred to concentrate
on his work in "my shrinking years." Behind him were his
long residency in San Francisco, the Presidential Medal of
Freedom and a banquet in his honour with President Carter,
lunch with Mrs. Thatcher at Chequers to discuss science fund-
ing, dinner with the President of Brazil to persuade him to
protect the Amazon. For a long while he was the face of the
computer revolution, and the voice of the new genetics, almost
as famous as Stephen Hawking. Now he was a near-recluse.
His only journeys were between his house in Camden Town
and his institute in King's Cross, two doors down from the
Hassabis Centre.
Reah wrote a long poem about his and Turing's life
together, published in the TLS and then in book form. The
poet and critic Ian Hamilton said in a review, "Here is a physi-
cist who can imagine as well as scan. Now bring me the poet

who can explain quantum gravity." When Adam appeared in
my life, I believed that only a poet, not a machine, could tell
me if Miranda would ever love me, or lie to me.
There must have been Turing algorithms buried in the
software of the Exocet series 8 missiles that a French company,
MBDA, had sold to the Argentine government. This fearsome
weapon, once fired from a jet in the general direction of a
ship, could recognise its profile and decide mid-flight whether
it was hostile or friendly. If the latter, it aborted its mission
and plunged harmlessly into the sea. If it missed its target
and overshot, it was able to double back and make two more
attempts. It closed on its prey at 5,000 miles an hour. Its opt-
out capacity was probably based on face-recognition software
that Turing developed in the mid-sixties. He had been look-
ing for ways to help people with prosopagnosia, a condition in
which sufferers are unable to recognise familiar faces. Gov-
ernment immigration control, defence companies and security
firms raided the work for their own purposes.
Since France was a NATO partner, strong representations
were made to the Elysee Palace by our government that MBDA
should be prevented from selling more Exocets or from pro-
viding technical assistance. A consignment bound for Peru,
Argentina's ally, was blocked. But other countries, including
Iran, were willing to sell. There was also a black market. Brit-
ish agents, posing as arms dealers, bought up the supply.
But the spirit of the free market was irrepressible. The
Argentinian military desperately needed help with the Exocet

software, which had not been fully installed by the time the
conflict began. Two Israeli experts, acting on their own, pre-
sumably on the offer of huge financial reward, flew to Argen-
tina. It was never discovered who cut their throats in a Buenos
Aires hotel. Many assumed it was British intelligence agents.
If so, they were too late. On the day the young Israelis bled
to death in their beds, four British ships were sunk, the next
day another three went down, and on the third another. In
all, an aircraft carrier, destroyers, frigates and a troop carrier
were sunk. The loss of life was in the low thousands. Sailors,
troops, cooks, doctors and nurses, journalists. After days of
confusion, with all military efforts concentrated on rescuing
survivors, the rump of the Task Force turned back and the
Falkland Islands became Las Malvinas. The fascist junta that
ruled Argentina was jubilant, its popularity soared, its murder,
torture and disappearances of its citizens were forgotten or for-
given. Its hold on power was consolidated.
I watched it all, horrified--and guilty. Having thrilled
to the sight of the warships filing down the English Chan-
nel, despite my opposition to the venture, I was implicated,
along with nearly everyone else. Mrs. Thatcher came out of 10
Downing Street to make a statement. First she couldn't speak,
then she was tearful but refused to be helped back inside.
1* inally she recovered and, in an untypically small voice, made
the famous "I take it on my shoulders" speech. She assumed
full responsibility. She would never outlive the shame. She
offered her resignation. But the shock to the nation of so many
deaths was profound and there was no appetite for heads to
roll. If she had to go, so did her entire cabinet, and most of the

country. A leader in the Telegraph put it thus: "The failure
belongs to us all. This is not the occasion for scapegoats." A
very British process began, reminiscent of the Dunkirk disas-
ter, by which a terrible defeat was transformed into a mourn-
ful victory. National unity was all. Six weeks later, 1.5 million
people were in Portsmouth to greet the returning ships with
their cargoes of corpses, their burned and traumatised passen-
gers. The rest of us watched it on television in horror.
I repeat this well-known history for the benefit of younger
readers who won't be aware of its emotional impact, and
because it formed a melancholy background to our three-
cornered household. The rent was due and I was concerned
by a loss of income. There was no mass purchase of hand-held
Union Jacks, champagne consumption was down, and the
general economy was in trouble, though pubs and hamburg-
ers went on as before. Miranda was lost to her father's illness
and to the Corn Laws and the historical viciousness of vested
interests, their indifference to suffering. Meanwhile, Adam
remained under the blanket. Miranda's delay in starting work
on him was in part due to technophobia, if that's the word
for disliking being online and ticking boxes with a mouse. I
nagged, and finally she agreed to make a start. A week after
the remains of the Task Force returned to port, I set up the lap-
top on the kitchen table and brought up Adam's site. It wasn't
necessary to wake him for her to begin. She picked up the
cordless mouse, turned it over and stared at its underside with
distaste. I made her coffee and went into the bedroom to work.
My portfolio had halved in value. I was supposed to be
recouping losses. But the thought of her next door was a dis-

traction. As so often in the mornings, I dwelt on our night
before. The misery enveloping the country had made it all the
more intense. Then we had talked. She described at length her
childhood, an idyll shattered by her mother's death when she
was eight. She wanted to take me to Salisbury and show me
the important locations. I took this as a sign of progress but she
had yet to suggest a date, and she hadn't said that she wanted
me to meet her father.
I was facing my screen without seeing it. The walls and
especially the door were thin. She was making very slow prog-
ress. At long intervals, I made out a deliberate click as she reg-
istered a choice. The silence between made me tense. Open to
experience? Conscientious? Emotionally stable? After an hour
I was getting nowhere and decided to go out. I kissed the top
of her head as I squeezed past her chair. I left the house and set
off towards Clapham.
It was unusually hot for April. The traffic down Clapham
High Street was heavy, the pavements were crowded. Every-
where, black ribbons. 1 he idea had crossed from the United
States. On lampposts and doors, in shop windows, on car door
handles and aerials, on pushchairs, wheelchairs and bikes.
In central London, on official buildings where Union Jacks
were at half mast, black ribbons dangled from the flagpoles
for the 2,920 dead. Black ribbons were worn as armbands and
on lapels I was wearing one myself and so was Miranda. I
would find one for Adam. Women and girls and flamboyant
tied them in their hair. The passionate minority who had
argued and marched against the invasion wore them too. For

public figures and celebrities, including the royal family, it
was hazardous not to wear one--the popular press was keep-
ing watch.
I had no ambition but to walk off my restless state. I
increased my pace through the business end of the High
Street. I passed the boarded-up office of the Anglo-Argentinian
Friendship Society. A rubbish collectors' walkout was in its
second week. The bags piled round lampposts were waist-high
and the heat was generating a sweet stench. The public, or its
press, agreed with the prime minister that a strike at such a
time was an act of heartless disloyalty. But the wage demands
were as inevitable as the next rise in inflation. No one knew
yet how to dissuade the snake from eating its tail. Very soon,
perhaps by the end of the year, stoical robots of negligible
intelligence would be picking up the rubbish. The men they
displaced would be even poorer. Unemployment was at sixteen
per cent.
By the curry house and along the greasy pavement outside
the fast-food chains, the smell of rotting meat was a force that
hit the chest. I held my breath until I was past the Tube sta-
tion. I crossed the road and walked onto the Common. There
were shouts and squeals rising from a crowd by the boating
and paddling pool. Even some of the kids splashing about were
wearing ribbons. It was a happy scene but I didn't linger. In
these new times a solitary man had to be wary of seeming to
stare at children.
So I strolled over to Holy Trinity Church, a huge brick Age
of Reason shed. There was no one inside. As I sat, hunched for-

ward, elbows on knees, I could have been mistaken for a wor-
shipper. It was too reasonable a place to evoke much awe, but
its clean lines and sensible proportions were soothing. I was
content to stay a while in the cool gloom and let my thoughts
drift back to our very first night together when I'd been woken
by a prolonged howl. I thought a dog was in the room and I
was half out of bed before I came to and realised that Miranda
was having a nightmare. It wasn't easy to wake her. She was
struggling, as if fighting with someone, and twice she mum-
bled, "Don't go in. Please." Afterwards I thought it would help
her to describe the dream. She was lying on my arm, clinging
to me tightly. When I asked her again, she shook her head, and
soon she was asleep.
In the morning, over coffee, she shrugged my ques-
tion away. Just a dream. That moment of evasion stood out
because Adam was behind us, making a good job of cleaning
the window, which I had told him, rather than asked him,
to do. While we were talking, he had paused and turned, as
if intrigued to hear an account of a nightmare. I wondered
then if he himself was subject to dreams. He was on my con-
science now. My command that morning had been snappish. I
shouldn't have treated him like a servant. Later that day I had
powered him down. I had left him switched off too long. Holy
Trinity Church was associated with William Wilberforce and
the anti-slavery movement. He would have promoted the cause
of the Adams and Eves, their right not to be bought and sold
and destroyed, their dignity in self-determination. Perhaps
they could take care of themselves. Soon they'd be doing the

dustmen's jobs. Doctors and lawyers were next in line. Pattern
recognition and faultless memory were even easier to compute
than gathering up the city's filth.
We could become slaves of time without purpose. Then
what? A general renaissance, a liberation into love, friendship
and philosophy, art and science, nature worship, sports and
hobbies, invention and the pursuit of meaning? But genteel
recreations wouldn't be for everyone. Violent crime had its
attractions too, so did bare-knuckle cage-fighting, VR pornog-
raphy, gambling, drink and drugs, even boredom and depres-
sion. We wouldn't be in control of our choices. I was proof of
that.
I wandered out across the open spaces of the Common. Fif-
teen minutes later I reached the far side and decided to turn
back. By now Miranda should have made at least a third of
her decisions. I was impatient to be with her before she set off
for Salisbury. She would be back late that night. I was resting
from the heat in the narrow shade of a silver birch. A few yards
away was a fenced-in little swing park for children. A small
boy--I guessed he was about four years old--dressed in baggy
green shorts, plastic sandals and a stained white t-shirt, was
bent over by a see-saw examining an object on the ground. He
tried to dislodge it with his foot, then he crouched down and
got his fingers to it.
I hadn't noticed his mother sitting on a bench with her
back to me. She called out sharply, "Get here!"
The boy looked up, seemed about to go towards her, then
his attention returned to the interesting thing on the ground.

Now he had moved, I saw it myself. It was a bottle top, glinting
dully, perhaps embedded in the softened tarmac.
The woman's back was broad, her hair black, curly, thin-
ning towards the crown. In her right hand was a cigarette. Her
elbow was cupped in her left hand. Despite the heat, she was
wearing a coat. Below the collar was a long tear.
"D'you hear me?" The threat was on a rising note. Again
the child looked up and seemed fearful and bound to obey. He
took a half-step, but as his gaze shifted, he saw his prize again
and faltered. When he went back to it, he may have thought
he could lever it free and take it to his mother. But what he
may have reasoned didn't matter. With a yelp of frustration,
the woman leaped from the bench, crossed the few yards of
playground at speed and dropped her cigarette as she grabbed
the boy by his arm and smacked his bare legs. At the instant of
his first cry, she smacked him again, and a third time.
I'd been comfortable in my thoughts and was reluctant to
be taken from them. For a moment I thought I could head for
home, pretending, if not to myself, then to the world, that I'd
seen nothing. There was nothing I could do about this little
boy's life.
His screams were angering his mother further. "Shut up!"
she shouted at him over and over again. "Shut up! Shut up!"
Even then I might have forced myself to ignore the scene.
But as the boy's shrieks grew louder, she seized his shoulders
in two hands, pulling his dirty t-shirt clear of his belly, and
began to shake him hard.
1 here are some decisions, even moral ones, that are formed
in regions below conscious thought. I found myself jogging

towards the playground's fence, stepping over it, taking three
paces and putting a hand on the woman's shoulder.
I said, "Excuse me. Please. Please don't do that."
My voice sounded prissy in my ears, privileged, apologetic,
lacking all authority. I was already doubting where this could
lead. Not to a future of reformed, kindly parenting. But at least,
as she turned towards me in disbelief, her assault had ceased.
"What was that?"
"He's just little," I said stupidly. "You could do him serious
harm."
"Who the fuck are you?"
It was the right question and for that reason I didn't answer
it. "He's too little to understand you."
This conversation was proceeding over the child's screams.
Now he clutched at his mother's skirts, wanting to be picked
up. This was the worst of it. His tormentor was also his only
comfort. She was squaring up to me. The dropped ciga-
rette smouldered by her foot. Her right hand clenched and
unclenched. Trying to appear not to, I took a vague half-step
back. We were staring each other out. It was, or had been, a
rather lovely, intelligent face, its obvious beauty marred by
weight gain plumping up the flesh round her eyes, narrowing
them into a look of suspicion. In another life it could have been
a kindly, maternal face. Rounded, high cheekbones, a slew of
freckles across the bridge of her nose, full lips--though the
lower was split. After several seconds, I noticed that her pupils
were pinpricks. She was the first to shift her gaze. She was
looking over my shoulder and then I found out why.
She yelled, "Oi, John."

I turned. Her friend or husband, John, also plump, naked
from the waist, bright pink from a bout in the sun, was on his
way through the playground's wire gate.
Still several yards away he called, "He bothering you?"
"Fucking right."
In some other sector of all imagined possibilities--the
cinematic would be one-
-I needn't have worried. John was
about my age, but shorter, flabbier, less fit, less strong. In that
other world, if he'd struck me, I could have floored him. But in
this world, I'd never hit another person in my life, not even in
childhood. I could have told myself that if I knocked the father
down the child would suffer all the more. But that wasn't it.
I had the wrong attitude, or rather, I lacked the right one. It
wasn't fear, it certainly wasn't lofty principle. When it came
to hitting people, I didn't know where to begin. I didn't want
to know.
"Oh yeah?"
Now John was squaring up to me, the woman having
stepped back. The boy continued to wail. Father and son were
comically alike--both crop-haired, ginger-blond, with small
faces and wide-apart green eyes.
"With all respect, he's just little. He shouldn't be hit or
shaken."
"With all respect, you can fuck off out of it. Or else."
And John did look ready to hit me. His chest was puffed
out, the ancient self-enlargement ploy of toads and apes and
many others. His breathing was rapid and his arms hung well
clear of his torso. I may have been stronger, but he would be
more reckless. Less to lose. Or this was what bravery was.

Being ready to take a chance on not getting felled and your
head lifted and slammed down on the tarmac many times,
with lifelong neural consequences. A chance I wouldn't take.
This was what cowardice was, a surfeit of imagining.
I raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. "Look. I can't
make you do anything, obviously. I can only hope to persuade
you. For the little boy's benefit."
Then John said something so surprising that I was com-
pletely outflanked and for a moment could hardly reply.
"Do you want him?"
"What?"
"You can have him. Go on. You're an expert on kids. He's
yours. Take him home with you."
The child had gone quiet by this point. Looking at him
again, I thought he had something his father lacked, though
perhaps not his mother--a faint but still luminous signal in
his expression of intelligent engagement, despite his distress.
We stood in a tight little group. From far across the Common
we heard, above the traffic, the distant shouts of children by
the paddling pool.
On an impulse, I called the father's bluff. "All right," I
said. "He can come and live with me. We'll sort out the paper-
work later."
I took a card from my wallet and gave it to him. Then I
put my hand out to the boy and to my surprise he raised his
and slotted his fingers between mine. I felt flattered. "What's
his name?"
"Mark."
"Come on, Mark."

Together we walked away from his parents, across the
playground to the spring-hinged gate.
The little boy said in a loud whisper, "Let's pretend to run
away." His upturned face was suddenly alive with humour
and mischief.
"OK."
"On a boat."
"All right."
I was about to open the gate when there was a shout
behind me. I turned, hoping that my relief didn't show. The
woman came running at me, pulled the boy away and swung
at me with an open hand. The blow fell harmlessly against my
upper arm.
"Pervert!"
She was ready to take another swing when John called out
in a weary tone. "Leave it."
I let myself out and walked a little way before stopping to
look back. John was hoisting Mark onto his raw shoulders. I had
to admire the father. There may have been wit in his methods
which I'd failed to notice. He had got rid of me without a fight
by making an impossible offer. What a nightmare, to drag the
boy back to my tiny place, introduce him to Miranda, then
see to his needs for the next fifteen years. I noticed that the
woman had a black ribbon tied to the arm of her coat. She
was trying to persuade John to take his shirt. He was ignoring
her. As the family crossed the playground, Mark turned in my
direction and raised an arm, perhaps to maintain his balance,
perhaps in farewell.

In our side-by-side conversations in bed, often in the early
hours, a figure presided whose form was becoming clearer as
he hovered before us in the darkness, an unfortunate ghost. I
had to overcome an initial impulse to regard him as a rival,
hostile to my very existence. 1 looked him up online and saw
his face through time, from early twenties to mid-fifties, evolv-
ing from girlishly handsome to appealingly ruined. I read his
press, which was not extensive. His name meant nothing to
me. A couple of my friends knew of him but had never read
him. A profile, five years old, dismissed him as "an almost-
man." Since the phrase described one of my own possible
fates, I warmed a little to Maxfield Blacke, and understood
the obvious--that to love the daughter would be to embrace
the father. Whenever she returned from Salisbury, she needed
to talk about him. I learned about his different pains, or ago-
nies, the shifting prognoses, the arrogant, ignorant doctor fol-
lowed by the kind and brilliant doctor, the chaotic hospital
with surprisingly good food, the treatments and medications,
the fresh hopes abandoned, then restored. His mind, she found
countless ways of saying, remained sharp. It was his body that
had turned against him, against itself, with the ferocity of a
civil war. How it hurt the daughter to see the writer's tongue
disfigured by ugly black spots. How it hurt the father to eat, to
swallow, to speak. His immune system was letting or taking
him down.
There was more. He passed a large kidney stone, as excru-

ciating, Miranda believed, as natural childbirth. He broke a
hip on the bathroom floor. His skin itched intolerably. Now he
had gout in the joints of both thumbs. Reading, his passion,
was made difficult as cataracts clouded his vision. The opera-
tion was ahead of him, though he hated and feared anyone
messing with his eyes. There may have been other afflictions
too humiliating to recount. The woman he should have asked
long ago to be his fourth wife had walked out two years ago.
Maxfield was alone, dependent on health visitors, strangers,
and on his daughter, ninety miles distant. His two sons by
another marriage sometimes travelled from London, bring-
ing presents of wine, cheese, biographies, the latest wristwatch
computer. But they were squeamish about their father's inti-
mate care.
We weren't old enough, Miranda and I, to understand
fully that a man in his late fifties was still too young to expect
or deserve such multiple insults. But his resemblance to Job
tortured by his pitiless God made it seem blasphemous to do
anything but listen to Miranda. The night after my encoun-
ter in the playground stood out. Hard to believe of a man in
love, but my mind wandered as she talked about him. She was
just back from Salisbury, describing a fresh torment as we lay
in bed. Sympathetically, I took her hand as she talked. The
constant sufferings of a man I had never met could only hold
me so long. Half listening, I was free to contemplate my life's
strange new turns.
Downstairs, still on the same hard wooden chair, my
interesting toy waited under its blanket, its merged personal-
ity installed that afternoon while it slept. The adventure

about to begin. At my side was my future, I was sure of it. The
imbalance in our feelings for each other would be righted. We
were simply the embodiment of a pattern in modern manners:
acquaintance, followed by sex, then friendship, finally love.
There was no good reason we should travel this conventional
course at the same speed. Patience was all.
Meanwhile, surrounding my islet of hopes was an ocean of
national sorrow. With ghastly timing, the junta had raised that
day 406 Argentine flags in Port Stanley, one for each of their
dead, and staged a military parade along the deserted, sodden
main street, while in London, in St. Paul's, a commemoration
service was held for our 5,000. I watched it on television after
I returned from the Common. There could hardly have been
two dozen in that vast congregation of the ruling elite who
thought that a God who preferred fascism to the Union Jack
was worth the candle, or that the departed reposed in eter-
nal bliss. But secular tradition couldn't provide such familiar
verses polished to a gleam by the long-discarded sincerity of
previous generations. Man that is born of woman hath but a
short time to live. So the hymns were sung, the impenetrable,
echoing readings intoned, the responses returned in ragged
unison, while the rest of us mourned at the altars of our TV
sets. Unlike Miranda, I mourned too.
With a million and a half others I had "marched" through
central London to protest against the Task Force. In fact we
crept along, stopping to wait at many bottlenecks. The usual
paradox held: the matter was grave, the demonstration joyous.

wild costumes, circus skills, speeches, and above all the exhil-

aration of such numbers, taking hours to file past, so diverse,
so clearly decent. So easy to believe that the whole nation had
invaded London to make the obvious point that the coming
war was unjust, inhumane, illogical, potentially catastrophic.
We couldn't know just how right we Were. Or how effectively
Parliament, the tabloids, the military and two-thirds of the
nation would dismiss us. It was said we were unpatriotic,
defending a fascist regime and opposing the rule of interna-
tional law.
Where was Miranda that day? We barely knew each
other then. She was in the library, making the final changes
to her half-wild-pigs paper. She had unusual ideas about the
Task Force for someone in her twenties, and she distrusted
the spirit of what she called a "self-loving crowd," its easy
like-mindedness, its stupid high spirits. She didn't share my
aptitude for protest or sentiment. She was not interested in
watching the ships leave, or in what came to be known as
The Sinking, or the inglorious return and still less the service
in St. Paul's. Where I had talked with friends about nothing
else for months and read every opinion on the affair, Miranda
stayed away. When the ships sank, she was silent. When the
black ribbons appeared, she wore one, but she wouldn't be
drawn. As she put it, the whole episode "stank."
Now, as I lay beside her with her hand in mine, the orange
streetlights beyond the curtains gave her bedroom the appear-
ance of a stage set. She had taken the last train home and
waited for a delayed lube to Clapham North. It was almost
three o'clock. She was describing how Maxfield had told her
ruefully that the gout in his thumbs was a blessing. The pain

was so ferocious and localised that his other complaints had
faded.
I was still holding her hand. I said, "You know how much
I want to meet him. Let me come with you next time.''
Several seconds passed before she drowsily replied, "I'd
like to go very soon."
"Good."
Then, after another pause, "Adam must come too."
She stroked my forearm in a gesture of farewell as she
turned on her side, away from me. Soon her breathing was
regular and deep, and I was left pondering in the monochrome
sodium dusk. He's coming too. She had assumed joint owner-
ship, just as I'd hoped. But an encounter between Adam and
an old-style literary curmudgeon like Maxfield Blacke was
hard to envisage. I knew from the profile that he still worked
in longhand, detested computers, mobile phones, the Internet
and all the rest. Apparently he didn't, in that priggish cliche,
"suffer fools gladly." Or robots. Adam had yet to be woken. He
had yet to leave the house, yet to test his luck as a plausible
being capable of small talk. I'd already decided to keep him
away from my circle of friends until he was a fully adept social
creature. Starting out with Maxfield could disable important
sub-routines. Miranda might have been hoping to distract her
father and energise his writing. Or it was to do with me, some-
how in my interests in ways I didn't understand. Or--I failed
to resist this thought--against them?
That was a bad idea, of the kind that comes in the small
hours. Like all insomniac brooding, the essence was repeti-
tion. Why should I meet her father in the presence of Adam?

Of course, it was entirely in my power to insist on keeping him
here. But I would be denying the wishes of a woman whose
father lay dying. Was he really dying? Was it possible to get
gout in your thumb? Bilaterally? Did I really know Miranda?
I lay on my side, seeking a cool corner of the pillow, then on
my back with a view of a dappled ceiling that now seemed
too close, and yellow rather than orange. I asked myself the
same questions, I rephrased them and asked them again. I
knew what I was about to do, but I delayed, preferring to fret,
denying the obvious for almost an hour. Then at last I got up,
pulled on my jeans and t-shirt, let myself out and went bare-
foot down the communal stairs to my own flat.
In the kitchen I didn't even pause before pulling the blan-
ket clear. Outwardly nothing had changed--eyes closed, that
same bronze face, the nose with its hint of cruelty. I reached
behind his head, found the spot and pressed. While he was
warming up I ate a bowl of cereal.
Just as I was finishing he said, "Never be disappointed."
"What was that?"
"I was saying that those who believe in the afterlife will
never be disappointed."
"\ou mean, if they're wrong they'll never know about it."
"Yes."
I looked at him closely. Was he different now? He had an
expectant look. "Logical enough. But Adam. I hope you don't
think that's profound."
He didn t reply. I took my empty bowl to the sink and made
myself tea. I sat at the table, across from him, and after taking

a couple of sips, I said, "Why did you say that I shouldn't trust
Miranda?"
"Oh, that. .
"Come on."
"I spoke out of turn and I'm truly sorry."
"Answer the question."
His voice had changed. It was firmer, more expressive in
its varied pitch. But the attitude--I needed more time. My
immediate, unreliable impression was of an intact presence.
"I was thinking only of your best interests."
"You just said you were sorry."
"That's correct."
"I need to hear why you said what you did."
"There's a small but significant possibility that she might
harm you."
I disguised my irritation and said, "How significant?"
"In the terms set by Thomas Bayes, the eighteenth-
century clergyman, I'd say one in five, assuming you accept
my values for the priors."
My father, adept at the harmonic progressions of bebop,
was a sincere technophobe. He used to say that any faulty elec-
trical device needed no more than a good thump. I drank my
tea and considered. In the colossal array of tree-branching net-
works that governed Adam's decision-making, there would be
a strong weighting in favour of reasonableness.
I said, "I happen to know that the possibility is insignifi-
cant, close to zero."
"I see. I'm so sorry."

"We all make mistakes."
"We certainly do."
"How many mistakes have you made in your life, Adam?"
"Only this one."
"Then it's important."
"Yes."
"And important not to repeat it."
"Of course."
"So we need to analyse how you came to make it, wouldn't
you say?"
"I agree."
"So, in this regrettable process what was your first move?"
He spoke confidently now, seeming to take pleasure in
describing his methods. "I have privileged access to all court
records, criminal as well as the Family Division, even when
in camera. Miranda's name was anonymised, but I matched
the case against other circumstantial factors that are also not
generally available."
"Clever."
"Thank you."
"Tell me about the case. And the date and place."
" I he young man, you see, knew very well that the first
time he had intimate relations with her . . ."
He broke off and stared at me, bug-eyed in astonishment,
as though he was taking in my presence for the first time. I
guessed my short run of discovery was coming to a close. He
appeared now to know about the value of reticence.
"Go on."
"Uh, she brought along a half-bottle of vodka."

"Give me a date and place and the man's name. Quick!"
"October the . . . Salisbury. But look--"
Then he began to giggle, a silly, hissing sound. It was
embarrassing to witness, but I couldn't look away. On his face
was a complicated look--of confusion, of anxiety, or mirthless
hilarity. The user's handbook claimed that he had forty facial
expressions. The Eves had fifty. As far as I knew, the average
among people was fewer than twenty-five.
"Get a grip, Adam. We agreed. We need to understand
your mistake."
It took him more than a minute to get himself under con-
trol. I drank the last of my tea and watched what I knew to be
a complex process. I understood that personality was not like
a shell, encasing and constraining his capacity for coherent
thought; that his deviousness, if that was what motivated him,
did not live downstream of reason. Nor did mine. His ratio-
nal impulse to collaborate with me may have pulsed through
his neural networks at half the speed of light, but it would
not have been suddenly barred at the logic gate of a freshly
devised persona. Instead, these two elements were entwined at
their origins, like the snakes of Mercury's caduceus. Adam saw
the world and understood it through the prism of his personal-
ity; his personality was at the service of his objectifying reason
and its constant updates. From the beginning of our conver-
sation, it had been simultaneously in his interests to avoid a
repetition of an error and to withhold information from me.
When the two became incompatible, he became incapaci-
tated and giggled like a child in church. Whatever we had
chosen for him lay far upstream of the branching intricacy of

his decision-making. In a different dispensation of character
he might simply have fallen silent; in another, he might have
been compelled to tell me everything. A case could be made
for both.
I now knew a little more than nothing, enough to worry
about, not enough to follow up, even if I'd had access to the
closed sessions of the courts: Miranda as witness, victim or
accused, sex with a young man, vodka, a courtroom, one Octo-
ber in Salisbury.
Adam had fallen silent. His expression, the special mate-
rial of his face, indistinguishable from skin, relaxed into
watchful neutrality. I could have gone upstairs and woken
Miranda to confront her with the obvious questions and get
everything clear between us. Or I could wait and reflect, hold-
ing back what I knew in order to grant myself the illusion of
control. A case could be made for both.
But I didn't hesitate. I went into my bedroom, undressed,
leaving my clothes in a heap on my desk, and lay down naked
under the summer duvet. It was already light. I would have
liked to be soothed and hear, above the dawn chorus, the sound
of the milkman going from door to door, clinking his bottles
on the steps. But the last of the electric-powered milk floats
had vanished from our streets. A shame. Still, I was tired and
suddenly comfortable. I here's a special sensuousness in an
unshared bed, at least for a period, until sleeping alone begins
to assume its own quiet sadness.

n the waiting room of the local doctor's practice, a dozen
junk-shop dining-room chairs were arranged round the
walls of what had once been a Victorian front parlour.
In the centre was a low plywood table with spindly metal legs
and a few magazines, greasy to the touch. I had picked one up
and immediately put it back. In one corner, some colourful
broken toys, a headless giraffe, a car with a missing wheel,
gnawed plastic bricks, kindly donated. There were no infants
in our group of nine. I was keen to avoid the gaze of the others,
their small talk or ailment-swapping. I kept my breathing
shallow in case the air around me swarmed with pathogens. I
didn't belong here. I wasn't ill, my problem was not systemic
but peripheral, a toenail. I was the youngest in the room,
surely the fittest, a god among mortals, with an appointment
not with the doctor but with the nurse. I remained beyond
mortality's reach. Decay and death were for others. I expected
my name to be called first. It turned out to be a long wait. I
was second to last.

dire warnings. I had time to read them all. A photograph
showed an elderly man in cardigan and slippers standing by a
window. Without raising a hand to his mouth, he was lustily
sneezing in the direction of a laughing little girl. Backlight-
ing illuminated tens of thousands of particles flying towards
her--minute droplets of fluid teeming with germs shared by
an old fool.
I reflected on the long strange history that lay behind this
tableau. The idea that germs were responsible for the spread of
disease didn't gain general acceptance until the 1880s and the
work of Louis Pasteur and others, only a hundred years before
this poster was devised. Until then, against a few dissenters,
the miasma theory prevailed--disease originated in bad air,
bad smells, decomposition, or even in night air, against which
windows were properly closed. But the device that could have
spoken truth to medicine was available 200 years before Pas-
teur. The amateur scientist of the seventeenth century who
knew best how to make and use the device was known to the
scientific elite of London.
When Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, solid citizen of Delft,
a draper and a friend of Vermeer, began sending his obser-
vations of microscopic life to the Royal Society in 1673, he
revealed a new world and initiated a biological revolution. He
meticulously described plant cells and muscle fibre, single-cell
organisms, his own spermatozoa, and bacteria from his own
mouth. His microscopes needed sunlight and had only a single
lens, but no one could grind them the way he could. He was
working with magnification powers of 275 and above. By the
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

end of his life, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
had published 190 of his accounts.
Suppose there had been a young spark at the Royal Society
lolling in the library after a good lunch, a copy of the Trans-
actions on his lap, who began to speculate that some of these
tiny organisms might cause meat to putrefy, or could multiply
in the bloodstream and cause disease. There had been such
sparks at the Society before and there were many to come. But
this one would have needed an interest in medicine as well
as scientific curiosity. Medicine and science would not become
full partners until well into the twentieth century. Even in
the fifties, tonsils were regularly sliced from the throats of
healthy children on the basis of standard practice rather than
good evidence. A doctor in Leeuwenhoek's time could easily
believe that everything to be known in his field was already
well understood. The authority of Galen, active in the second
century, was near total. It would be a long time before medical
men, in general a grand lot, peered humbly down a micro-
scope in order to learn the basics of organic life.
But our man, whose name will become a household word,
is different. His hypotheses will be possible to test. He bor-
rows a microscope--Robert Hooke, honoured fellow of the
Society, will surely lend him one--and sets to. A germ theory
of disease begins to form. Others join in the research. Per-
haps within twenty years surgeons are washing their hands
between patients. The reputations of forgotten doctors like
Hugh of Lucca and Girolamo Fracastoro are restored. By the
mid-eighteenth century, childbirth is safer; certain men and

women of genius are born who otherwise would have died in
infancy. They might change the course of politics, the arts,
the sciences. Loathsome figures who could do great harm also
spring up. In minor and possibly major ways, history follows a
different course long after our brilliant young member of the
Royal Society has grown old and died.
The present is the frailest of improbable constructs. It
could have been different. Any part of it, or all of it, could
be otherwise. True of the smallest and largest concerns. How
easy to conjure worlds in which my toenail had not turned
against me; in which I was rich, living north of the Thames
after one of my schemes had succeeded; in which Shakespeare
had died in childhood and no one missed him, and the United
States had taken the decision to drop on a Japanese city the
atomic bomb they had tested to perfection; or in which the
Falklands Task Force had not set off, or had returned victori-
ous and the country was not in mourning; in which Adam was
an assemblage far off in the future; or in which 66 million
years ago the earth had turned for another few minutes before
the meteor struck, so missing the sun-blotting, fine-grained
gypsum sand of the Yucatan, allowing the dinosaurs to live on
and deny future space to the mammals, clever apes included.
My treatment, when it came at last, began pleasantly
with my naked foot soaking in a bowl of hot, soapy water.
Meanwhile, the nurse, a large, friendly woman from Ghana,

business with my ingrowing toenail, I was not too proud to
squeak at the crucial moment. Relief was immediate. I made
my way along the street, as though on rubber wheels, to my
home, the centre of my preoccupations, which had lately
shifted from Miranda back to Adam.
His character was in, done, from two sources irreversibly
merged. A curious parent of a growing child might wonder
which characteristics belonged to the father, which to the
mother. I was observing Adam closely. I knew which questions
Miranda had answered but I didn't know what she had decided.
I noted that a certain blankness had gone from his face, that
he seemed more intact, smoother in his interactions with
us and certainly more expressive. But I struggled to under-
stand what it told me about Miranda or, for that matter, about
myself. In humans, recombination is infinitely subtle and then
crudely but disarmingly lopsided. The parents merge, like flu-
ids stirred together, but the mother's face might be faithfully
replicated in her child just as the father fails to pass on his gift
for comedy. I remembered little Mark's touching version of
his father's features. But in Adam's personality, Miranda and
I were well shuffled, and as in humans, his inheritance was
thickly overlaid by his capacity to learn. Perhaps he had my
tendency to pointless theorising. Perhaps he had something of
Miranda's secretive nature and her self-possession, her taste
for solitude. Frequently he withdrew into himself, humming
or murmuring "Ah!" Then he would pronounce what he took
to be an important truth. His interrupted remark about the
afterlife was the earliest example.
Another was when we were outside, in my tiny fraction

of a back garden, marked off by a broken picket fence. He was
helping to pull up weeds. It was just before sunset, the air was
still and warm, suffused by an unreal amber light. A week had
passed since our late-night exchange. I had brought him out-
side because his dexterity was still a matter of interest to me. I
wanted to watch him handle a hoe and a rake. More generally,
my plan was to introduce him to the world beyond the kitchen
table. We had friendly neighbours on both sides and there was
a chance that he could test his small-talk skills. If we were to
travel together to Salisbury to meet Maxfield Blacke, I wanted
to prepare Adam by taking him to some shops, and perhaps
a pub. I was sure he could pass off as a person, but he needed
to be more at ease, his machine-learning capacities needed
stretching.
I was keen to see how good he was at identifying plants.
Of course he knew everything. Feverfew, wild carrot, camo-
mile. As he worked, he muttered the names, for his own
rather than my benefit. I saw him put on gardening gloves
to pull up nettles. Mere mimicry. Later he straightened and
looked with apparent interest towards a spectacular western
sky intersected by power and telephone lines and a receding
jumble of Victorian roofs. His hands were on his hips and he
leaned back, as though his lower back was giving him trouble.
He took a deep breath to indicate his appreciation of the eve-
ning air. Then, out of nowhere, he said, "From a certain point
of view, the only solution to suffering would be the complete
extinction of humankind."
Yes, this was why he needed to be out and about. Buried

within his circuitry there was probably a set of sub-routines:
sociability/conversation/interesting openers.
But I decided to join in. "It's been said that killing every-
one would be a cure for cancer. Utilitarianism can be logically
absurd."
He replied, "Obviously!" in an abrupt manner. I looked at
him, surprised, and he turned away from me and bent again
to his work.
Adam's insights, even when valid, were socially inept.
On our first expedition away from home, we walked the 200
yards to our local newsagent, Mr. Syed. We passed a few peo-
ple in the street and no one gave Adam a second glance. That
was satisfying. Over bare skin he was wearing a tight yellow
jumper, knitted by my mother in her last year. He had white
jeans and canvas loafers, bought for him by Miranda. She had
promised to buy him a complete outfit of his own. With his
neat muscular bulge of chest and arms, he could have passed
for a personal trainer from the local gym.
Where the pavement narrowed between a tree and a gar-
den wall, I saw how he stood aside to let a woman with a push-
chair through.
As we neared the shop he said, somewhat absurdly, "It's
good to get out."
Simon Syed had grown up in a large village thirty miles
north of Calcutta. His English teacher at his school had been
an Anglophile, a martinet who had beaten into his pupils a
courteous and precise English. I had never asked Simon how
or why he had taken on a Christian forename. Perhaps a

desire to integrate, or the parting insistence of his formidable
teacher. He had arrived in north Clapham from Calcutta in his
late teens and immediately went to work in his uncle's shop.
Thirty years later, the uncle had died and the shop passed to
the nephew, who still supported his aunt from the proceeds.
He also supported a wife and three grown-up children, but he
didn't like to talk about them. He was a Muslim, by culture
rather than practice. If there was sadness in his life, it was well
concealed behind a dignified manner. Now in his mid-sixties,
he was sleek, bald, very correct, with a small moustache that
tapered to sharp points. There was an anthropology journal,
not available on the Internet, that he kept for me. He didn't
mind when 1 came in to scan the world's front pages during
the Task Force days. He was amused by my taste for low-grade
chocolate--those global brands invented between two world
wars. In the mid-afternoons, after hours at my screen, I craved
sugar.
In that strange way by which one reserves intimacies for a
mere acquaintance, I had told Simon about my new girlfriend.
When she and I had been in the shop together, he had seen for
himself.
Now, whenever I came by, his first question was always,
"How are matters proceeding?" He liked to tell me, on the
basis of nothing but kindness, "It's clear. Her fate is you. No
dodging it! Eternal happiness for you both." I sensed that many
disappointments were heaped behind him. He was old enough
to be my father and wanted for me what had eluded him.
There were no other customers when Adam and I entered
the cramped shop with its compound scent of newsprint, pea-

nut dust and cheap toiletries. Simon rose from the wooden
chair he sat on behind the till. Because I was not alone, he
would not be asking the usual question.
I made the introduction. "Simon. My friend Adam."
Simon nodded. Adam said, "Hello," and smiled.
1 was reassured. A good start. If Simon had noticed the
strange appearance of Adam's eyes, he didn't show it. It was
a common reaction, I would soon discover. People assumed
a congenital deformity and politely looked away. Simon and
I discussed the cricket--three consecutive sixes and a pitch
invasion at the India--England T20--while Adam stood apart
before an array of canned goods on a shelf. They would be
instantly familiar to him, their commercial histories, mar-
ket share, nutritional value. But as we chatted, it was obvious
he wasn't looking at tins of peas, or anything at all. His face
was frozen. He hadn't moved in two minutes. I worried that
something unusual or unpleasant was about to happen. Simon
politely pretended he hadn't noticed. It was possible that
Adam had put himself in rest mode. I made a mental note: he
was in need of an appearance of plausibility whenever doing
nothing. His eyes were open, but he failed to blink. Perhaps
I had brought him out into the world too soon. Simon would
be offended that I had tried to pass off Adam as a person, a
friend. It could look like mockery, a tasteless joke. I would have
betrayed a pleasant acquaintance.
The cricket banter began to falter. Simon's gaze settled on
Adam, then returned to me. He said tactfully, "Your Anthro-
pos is in."
It was my prompt to go over to the magazines, where
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

Adam stood. Years ago, Simon had cleared his top shelf of soft
porn in favour of specialist stuff--literary magazines, aca-
demic bulletins of international relations, history, entomology.
A fair number of ageing, down-at-heel intellectuals lived in
the neighbourhood.
As I turned away he added, "You can get it yourself?" A
gentle tease to lower the tension. Simon was taller and he usu-
ally reached up for me.
A single word brought Adam to life. With the faintest
whirring sound, which I hoped only I could hear, he turned to
address Simon in formal terms. "Your self, you say. There's a
coincidence. I've been giving some thought lately to the mys-
tery of the self. Some say it's an organic element or process
embedded in neural structures. Others insist that it's an illu-
sion, a by-product of our narrative tendencies."
There was a silence, then, stiffening a little, Simon said,
"Well, sir, which is it? What have you decided?"
"It's the way I'm made. I'm bound to conclude that I've a
very powerful sense of self and I'm certain that it's real and
that neuroscience will describe it fully one day. Even when it
does, I won't know this self any better than I do now. But I do
have moments of doubt when I wonder whether I'm subject to
a form of Cartesian error."
By this time I had the journal in my hands and was pre-
paring to leave. "Take the Buddhists," Simon said. "They pre-
fer to get along without a self."
"Indeed. I'd like to meet one. Do you know any?"
Simon was emphatic. "No, sir. Absolutely, I do not."

I raised a hand in farewell and thanks and, taking Adam
by his elbow, guided him towards the door.
It was a cliche of romantic love, but no less painful for
that: the stronger my feelings, the more remote and unattain-
able Miranda appeared. How could I complain when she was
attained that very first night, after dinner? We had fun, we
talked easily, we ate and slept together most nights. But I was
greedy for more, though I tried not to show it. I wanted her to
open up to me, to want me, need me, show some hunger for
me, some delight in me. Instead, my initial impression held--
she could take me or leave me. Everything good that passed
between us--sex, food, movies, new plays--was instigated by
me. Without me she drifted in silence towards her default con-
dition upstairs, to a book on the Corn Laws, a bowl of cereal,
a cup of weak herbal tea, curled up in an armchair, barefoot
and oblivious. Sometimes she sat for long periods without a
book. If I put my head round her door (we now had keys to
each other's places) and said, "How about an hour of frantic
sex?" she would say calmly, "OK," and we would go into her
or my bedroom and she would rise splendidly to her pleasures
and mine. When we were done she would take a shower and
return to her chair. Unless I suggested something else. A glass
of wine, a risotto, an almost famous sax player at a Stockwell
pub. OK again.
To everything I proposed, indoors or out, she brought the
same tranquil readiness. Happy to hold my hand. But there

was something, or many things, I didn't understand, or she
didn't want me to know about. Whenever she had a seminar
or needed to use the library, she returned from college in the
late afternoons. Once a week she came back later. It took me a
while to notice that it was always a Friday. Finally she told me
that she went to the Regent's Park Mosque for Friday prayers.
That surprised me. But no, she wasn't thinking of convert-
ing from atheism. She had in mind a social-history paper she
might write. I wasn't convinced, but I let it go.
What we lacked was conversational intimacy. We were
closest when we argued about the Task Force. When we went
to a bar, her conversation was general. She was happy with
her solitude or with lively chat about public matters, but there
was nothing personal in between, except her father's health or
his literary career. When I tried to ease us towards the past,
perhaps angling in gently with something about myself or a
question about her own history, she reached quickly for gen-
eralities or an account of the earliest years of her childhood,
or an anecdote about someone she knew. I told her about my
idiotic excursion into tax fraud, my experience of court and
the tedium of my hours of community service. I would have
told her anyway, but the story was my pretext to ask if she
herself had ever been in court. The answer was abrupt. Never!
And then she changed the subject. I'd been in various promis-

and knew better than to put her under pressure. I still thought

one. Tact was everything. I still hadn't told her that I loved
her, or divulged my fantasies about our shared future or even
hinted at my frustration. I left her alone with her books or her
thoughts whenever it suited her. Though the subject was not
in the line of my interests, I worked up an acquaintance with
the Corn Laws and developed some ideas of my own about free
trade. She didn't dismiss them, but nor was she impressed.
So here we were upstairs at dinner in her kitchen, which
was even smaller than mine. The table was of white moulded
plastic, just big enough for two, probably stolen from a pub
garden by a previous tenant. Standing at the sink, up to his
elbows in suds, Adam dealt with the plates and cutlery we'd
handed him at the end of our meal--toad-in-the-hole, baked
beans, fried eggs. Student food. On the windowsill, where
yellow gingham curtains hung still in our late-summer heat
wave, a radio was playing the Beatles, recently regrouped after
twelve years apart. Their album, Love and Lemons, had been
derided for its grandiosity, for failing to resist the lure and
overreach of an eighty-strong symphony orchestra. They could
not master such forces, was the general drift, with half a life-
time's store of guitar chords. Nor did we wish to be told again,
the Times critic complained, that love was all we needed, even
if it were true, which it was not.
But I liked the music's muscular sentimentality, emptied
of irony by these middle-aged performers, so confident and
tuneful, liberated by useful ignorance of two and a half cen-
turies of symphonic experimentation. Lennon's rasping voice
floated towards us from some faraway echoing place beyond
the horizon, or the grave. I didn't mind being told again about

love. Here before me were all of its warm possibilities, barely
three feet away, and it was all I needed. Here was her long,
exquisitely shaped face (those angled cheekbones might break
through the skin one day), the amused gaze, at this point still
merry, and narrowed, locked on me, the lips parted, for she
was about to speak against what I'd just said. Her perfect elon-
gated nose flared faintly at the base of the nostrils' arch to
signal in advance her dissent. Her pallor set off her fine brown
hair, tonight childishly parted dead centre. Against prevailing
fashion, she kept out of the sun. Her bare white arms were also
thin and unblemished--not a single freckle.
From my point of view we still holidayed in the foothills,
among possibilities whose fulfilment rose like distant alps. I
tried to ignore them in order to attend to details. From her
perspective, on the other side of this frail table, we may have
already reached our highest point. She may have thought she
was as close as she ever wanted to be, or could be, to another
person. Love stories like Jane Austen's used to conclude chastely
with preparations for a wedding. Now their climax lay on the
far side of carnal knowledge, where all of complexity waited.
For now, my business was to conduct a political argument
with her without feelings running high, then turning sour,
and at the same time stay true to myself and let her do the
same. It was a feasible balancing act, as long as 1 drank less
than half a bottle of the indifferent Medoc that stood between
us. We'd had this conversation before and it should have been
easier now, but repetition seemed like an indictment of us
both. We didn't really want to be talking about it. Impossible
to avoid, even though we knew it would lead nowhere. But

this was how it was for everyone. We were all still tending
the wound. How could Miranda and I spend our lives together
when we couldn't agree on such a fundamental as war?
About the islands formerly known as the Falklands she
had firm views. She insisted that the Argentine flag-planting
on remote South Georgia had been a clear violation of inter-
national law. I said it was an inhospitable place and no one
should be asked to fight to the death for it. She said that the
taking of Port Stanley was the desperate act of an unpopular
regime looking to whip up patriotic fervour. I said this was
all the more reason not to get drawn in. She said the Task
Force was a brave and brilliant conception, even in failure.
I said, uneasily remembering my emotional state when the
ships set off, that it was a ridiculous enactment of lost imperial
grandeur. How could I not see, she said, that this was an anti-
fascist war? No (I spoke over her), it was a row over property,
fed on each side by nationalistic stupidity. I summoned the
Borges observation: two bald men fighting over a comb. She
replied that a bald man might hand down his comb to his chil-
dren. I was struggling to understand this when she added that
the generals had tortured, disappeared and killed their citi-
zens by the thousands and were running the economy into the
ground. If we'd taken back the islands, the humiliation would
have finished the military regime and democracy would have
returned to Argentina. I replied that she could not possibly
know this. We had lost thousands of young men and women
to the cause of Mrs. Thatcher's ambitions. My voice began to
rise before I remembered. I resumed quietly but with a cer-
tain tremor: that she remained in office after such slaughter

was the greatest political scandal of our time. I delivered this
with a finality that deserved a moment's respectful silence, but
Miranda came straight back to tell me that the prime minister
failed in a decent cause and was supported by almost all of
Parliament and the country and she was right to remain in
office.
During this conversation, Adam finished with the dishes
and stood with his back to the kitchen sink to watch us, arms
folded, his head turning from side to side, speaker to speaker,
like a spectator at a tennis match. Our exchange was not
exactly weary, but repetition had given it an air of ritual. Like
facing armies, we'd taken up our positions and intended to
hold them. Miranda was telling me that the Task Force set off
without proper ship-to-air missiles. The chiefs of staff let the
armed forces down. I used to hear terms like these--ship-to-
air, homing devices, titanium-tipped--at the Warwickshire
student union bar, but only from men, men of the political left,
whose opinions were complicated by tacit admiration for the
weapon systems they condemned. In her soft and fluent deliv-
ery, she mingled these with other concepts from the lexicon of
established power--the open society, rule of law, restoration of
democracy. Perhaps it was her father I was hearing.
While she was speaking, I turned to catch Adam's expres-
sion. What I saw was his devoted attention. More than that. A
look of delight. He adored what she was saying. 1 turned back
to Miranda as she reminded me that the Falklanders were my
fellow citizens, now living under fascism. Was I happy with
that? I disliked this rhetorical turn. It was a masked insult.
The conversation was turning sour, just as I'd feared, but I

couldn't help myself. In the tiny kitchen space, I was hot and
irritable as I reached for the wine and filled my glass. There
could have been a negotiated settlement, I started to say. A
slow and painless thirty-year transition, a UN mandate, guar-
anteed rights. She interrupted to inform me that we could
never trust any undertaking by the murdering generals. As
she said it, I saw them in caricature, in braided hats, campaign
ribbons, cavalry boots, and Galtieri on his white horse in a
confetti blizzard on the Avenida 25 de Mayo.
I said that I accepted every last one of her arguments. The
forces set off on their 8,000-mile mission, her risky strategy
was tested and it failed. Thousands she never knew or cared
about were drowned or burned to death, or live on, maimed,
disfigured, traumatised. We've arrived at the worst outcome:
the junta possessed the island and its inhabitants. Whereas a
policy of slow, negotiated agreement wasn't tested, but if it had
failed we would have reached the same outcome, without the
agony and death. We couldn't know. What might have hap-
pened was lost to us. So what was there to argue about?
I saw that the glass I'd filled, and had no memory of touch-
ing, was empty. And I was wrong. There was plenty to argue
about, for even as I said it, I knew I was crossing a line. I had
accused her of not caring about the dead, and she was angry.
Her eyes were narrowed, without merriment, but she
didn't address my transgression. Instead, she turned to Adam
and asked quietly, "What's your view?"
His gaze travelled from her to me and back. I still didn't
know whether he actually saw anything. An image on some
internal screen that no one was watching, or some diffused cir-

cuitry to orient his body in three-dimensional space? Seeming
to see could be a blind trick of imitation, a social manoeuvre to
fool us into projecting onto him a human quality. But I couldn't
help it: when our eyes briefly met and I looked into the blue
irises flecked with spears of black, the moment appeared rich
with meaning, with anticipation. I wanted to know whether
he understood, as I did, and as Miranda surely did, that the
issue here was loyalty.
His tone was prompt and calm. "Invasion, success or fail-
ure. Negotiated settlement, success or failure. Four outcomes
or effects. Without benefit of hindsight, we'd have to choose
which causes to pursue, which to avoid. We'd be in the realm
of Bayesian inverse probability. We'd be looking for the prob-
able cause of an effect rather than the most likely effect of a
cause. Only sensible, to try and find a formal representation of
our guesswork. Our reference point, our datum, would be an
observer of the Falklands situation before any decisions were
taken. Certain a priori probability values are ascribed to the
four outcomes. As fresh information comes in, we can measure
relative changes in probability. But we can't possess an abso-
lute value. It may help us to define the weight of new evidence
logarithmically, so that, assuming a base ten--"
"Adam. Enough! Really. What nonsense!" Now it was
Miranda who reached for the Medoc.
1 was relieved to be no longer the object of her irritation.
I said, "But Miranda and I would ascribe completely different
a priori values."
Adam turned his head towards me. As always, too slowly.

"Of course. As I said, when describing the future there can be
no absolute values. Only shifting degrees of likelihood."
"But they're entirely subjective."
"Correct. Ultimately Bayes reflects a state of mind. As
does all of common sense."
Then nothing was solved, despite this high gloss of ratio-
nality. Miranda and I had different states of mind. What was
new? But we were united against Adam in our differences. At
least, this was my hope. He may have understood the relevant
issue after all: he thought I was right about the Falklands and,
given a degree of programmed intellectual honesty, the best
he could offer Miranda, to whom he was also loyal, was an
appearance of neutrality. But if that was sound, why not accept
the mirror possibility, that he believed Miranda was right and
I was the one in receipt of loyal support?
With a sudden scrape of a kitchen chair, Miranda stood.
There was a faint flush about her face and throat and she
wasn't looking at me. We'd be sleeping in separate beds that
night. I would have happily unsaid my entire argument to stay
with her. But I was dumb.
She said to Adam, "You can stay up here to charge, if you
like."
Adam needed six hours a night connected to a thirteen-
amp socket. He went into sleep mode and sat quietly "reading"
until after dawn. Usually he was in my kitchen downstairs,
but recently Miranda had bought a second charging cable.
He murmured his thanks and slowly folded a kitchen
towel in half with close attention, hunched over the task, and

spread it across the draining board. As she moved towards her
bedroom door she shot me a look, a regretful smile that didn't
part her lips, sent a conciliatory kiss across the space between
us and whispered, "Just for tonight."
So we were fine.
I said, "Of course I know you care about the dead."
She nodded and left. Adam was sitting down, pulling his
shirt clear of his belt to locate the tethering point below his
waistline. I put a hand on his shoulder and thanked him for
clearing up.
For me, it was far too early for bed and it was hot, like a
summer evening in Marrakech. I went downstairs and looked
in the fridge for something cool.
I remained in the kitchen, in an old leather armchair,
with a balloon glass of Moldovan white. There was much plea-
sure in following a line of thought without opposition. I was
hardly the first to think it, but one could see the history of
human self-regard as a series of demotions tending to extinc-
tion. Once we sat enthroned at the centre of the universe, with
sun and planets, the entire observable world, turning around
us in an ageless dance of worship. Then, in defiance of the
priests, heartless astronomy reduced us to an orbiting planet
around the sun, just one among other rocks. But still we stood
apart, brilliantly unique, appointed by the creator to be lords
of everything that lived. Then biology confirmed that we were
at one with the rest, sharing common ancestry with bacte-
ria, pansies, trout and sheep. In the early twentieth century

came deeper exile into darkness when the immensity of the
universe was revealed and even the sun became one among
billions in our galaxy, among billions of galaxies. Finally, in
consciousness, our last redoubt, we were probably correct to
believe that we had more of it than any creature on earth. But
the mind that had once rebelled against the gods was about to
dethrone itself by way of its own fabulous reach. In the com-
pressed version, we would devise a machine a little cleverer
than ourselves, then set that machine to invent another that
lay beyond our comprehension. What need then of us?
Such hot-air thoughts deserved a second, bigger balloon
and I poured it. Head propped in my right palm, I approached
that ill-lit precinct where self-pity becomes a mellow plea-
sure. I was a special case of the general banishment, though it
wasn't Adam I was thinking of. He wasn't cleverer than me.
Not yet. No, my exile was for one night only and it gave a twist
of sweet, bearable agony to a hopeless love. My shirt unbut-
toned to the waist, all windows open, the urban romance of
getting thoughtfully drunk amid the heat and dust and muted
din of north Clapham, in a world city. The imbalance of our
affair was heroic. I imagined an onlooker's approving gaze
from a corner of the room. That well-formed figure slumped
in his beaten-up chair. I rather loved myself. Someone had
to. I rewarded myself with thoughts of her, mid-ecstasy, and
considered the impersonal quality of her pleasures. I was only
good enough for her, as many men might be. I refused the obvi-
ous, that her distance was the whip that drove my longing. But
here was something strange. Three days before, she had asked
a mysterious question. We were mid-embrace, in the conven-

tional position. She drew my face towards hers. Her look was
serious.
She whispered, "Tell me something. Are you real?"
I didn't reply.
She turned her head away so that I saw her in profile as her
eyes closed and she lost herself once more in a maze of private
pleasure.
Later that night, I asked her about it. "It was nothing,"
was all she said before she changed the subject. Was I real?
Meaning did I really love her, or was I honest, or did I fit her
needs so exactly that she might have dreamed me up?
I crossed the kitchen to pour the last of the wine. The bro-
ken fridge door handle needed a sharp sideways pull to engage
its lock. As my hand closed round the cold neck of the bottle, I
heard a sound, a creak above my head. I had lived long enough
beneath Miranda's feet to know her steps and their precise
direction. She had moved across her bedroom and was hesi-
tating in the threshold of her kitchen. I heard the murmur of
her voice. No reply. She took another two steps into the room.
The next would bring her onto a floorboard that under pres-
sure made a truncated quacking sound. As I waited to hear it,
Adam spoke. He pushed his chair back as he stood. If he was
to take another step he would need to untether himself. This
he must have achieved because it was his tread that landed
on the noisy floorboard. That meant they were standing less
than a metre apart, but there was no sound until a minute
had passed, and now it was footsteps, two sets, moving back
towards the bedroom.
I left the fridge door open because the sound of it closing

would betray me. No choice but to shadow them into my bed-
room. So I went and stood by my desk and listened. I reckoned
I was right under her bed when I heard the murmur of her
voice, a command. She must have wanted air in the room, for
Adam's steps tracked across the room towards the Victorian
bay. Only one of its three windows opened. Even that one was
hard to shift on a warm or rainy day. The old wooden frames
shrank or expanded, and something was wrong with the coun-
terweight and hardened rope. Our age could devise a passable
replica of a human mind, but there was no one in our neigh-
bourhood to fix a sash window, though a few had tried.
And how was my mind as I stood directly below, in an
identical bay, reproduced by the thousands in late-Victorian
industrial-scale developments? They had spilled across the
five-acre fields of hedgerow and boundary oaks that adorned
the southern limits of London. Not good--my mind, that is.
Embodied, it told all. Shivering, moist, especially on the palms,
raised pulse, in a state of elated anticipation. Fear, self-doubt,
fury. In my bay, old fitted carpet, stained and worn since the
mid-fifties, extended right to the skirting boards. In Miran-
da's, the carpet gave way to bare boards that, two world wars
back, must have been polished to a nut-brown gleam. Some
poor girl in white apron and mob cap, on all fours, waxed cloth
in hand, never could have dreamed of the kind of being who
would one day stand in the place where she crouched. I heard
him plant his feet on the old wood, I imagined him stooping to
grip the window by the metal fixtures on its lower frame and
heave upwards with the strength of four young men. There
was a silence of straining resistance before the entire window

shot upwards and hit the top casing with a rifle crack and a
shattering of glass. My snort of delight could have given me
away.
No shortage now of marginally cooler air filling the
room. My glee faded as Adam's footsteps returned to where
Miranda waited by the bed. As he went towards her, it might
have been an apology that he muttered. Here was the sound
of her forgiving him, for her brief sentence was followed by
the entwined mezzo and tenor of their laughter. I had trailed
after Adam and was once more by the bed, six feet under. He
had the manual skills to undress her and he was undressing
her now. What else would occupy their silence? 1 knew-
course I knew--that her mattress made no sound. Futons,
with their Japanese promise of a clean and simple life of
stripped-back clarity, were the fashion then. And I myself felt
washed in clarity, senses cleansed as I stood in the dark and
waited. I could have run up the stairs and prevented them,
burst into the bedroom like the clownish husband in an old
seaside postcard. But my situation had a thrilling aspect, not
only of subterfuge and discovery, but of originality, of modern
precedence, of being the first to be cuckolded by an artefact. I
was of my times, riding the breaking crest of the new, ahead
of everyone in enacting that drama of displacement so fre-
quently and gloomily predicted. Another element of my pas-
sivity: even at this earliest moment, I knew I had brought the
whole thing down on myself. But that was for later. For now,
despite the horror of betrayal, it was all too interesting and I
couldn't stir from my role of eavesdropper, the blind voyeur,
humiliated and alert.

It was my mind's eyes, or my heart's, that watched as
Adam and Miranda lay down on the unyielding embrace of
the futon and found the comfortable posture for a clasp of
limbs. I watched as she whispered in his ear, but I didn't hear
the words. She had never whispered in my ear at such times.
I saw him kiss her--longer and deeper than I had ever kissed
her. The arms that heaved up the window frame were tightly
around her. Minutes later I almost looked away as he knelt
with reverence to pleasure her with his tongue. This was the
celebrated tongue, wet and breathily warm, adept at uvulars
and labials, that gave his speech its authenticity. I watched,
surprised by nothing. He didn't fully satisfy my beloved then,
as I would have, but left her arching her slender back, eager
for him as he arranged himself above her with smooth, slow-
loris formality, at which point my humiliation was complete.
I saw it all in the dark--men would be obsolete. I wanted to
persuade myself that Adam felt nothing and could only imi-
tate the motions of abandonment. That he could never know
what we knew. But Alan Turing himself had often said and
written in his youth that the moment we couldn't tell the dif-
ference in behaviour between machine and person was when
we must confer humanity on the machine. So when the night
air was suddenly penetrated by Miranda's extended ecstatic
scream that tapered to a moan and then a stifled sob--all this
I actually heard twenty minutes after the shattering of the
window--I duly laid on Adam the privilege and obligations of
a conspecific. I hated him.

Early the following morning, for the first time in years, I
tipped into my coffee a heaped spoon of sugar. I watched the
confined, nut-brown disc of fluid turn, then slow, in its clock-
wise motion, then lose all purpose in a chaotic swirl. Tempting,
but I resisted a metaphor for my own existence. 1 was trying to
think and it was barely seven thirty. Soon Adam or Miranda
or both would appear at my door. I wanted my thoughts and
attitude in coherent form. After a night of broken sleep, I was
depressed as well as angry with myself, and determined not
to appear so. Miranda had kept her distance from me and so,
by contemporary standards, a night with someone else, even
something else, was not quite a betrayal. As for the ethical
dimensions of Adam's behaviour, here was a history with a
curious beginning. It was during the miners' strike of twelve
years before that self-driving cars first appeared on experi-
mental sites, mostly disused airfields, where movie set design-
ers had constructed imitation streets, motorway junctions and
various hazards.
"Autonomous" was never the right word, for the new cars
were as dependent as newborn babies on mighty networks of
computers linked to satellites and on-board radar. If artificial
intelligence was to guide these vehicles safely home, what
set of values or priorities should be assumed in the software?
Fortunately, in moral philosophy there already existed a well-
explored set of dilemmas known in the business as "the trolley
problem." Adapted easily to cars, the sort of problem manu-
facturers and their software engineers now posed was this:
you, or rather, your car is driving at the maximum legal speed
along a narrow suburban road. The traffic is flowing nicely.
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

On the pavement on your side of the road is a group of chil-
dren. Suddenly one of them, a child of eight, runs out across
the road, right into your path. There's a fraction of a second to
make a decision--either mow the child down or swerve onto
the crowded pavement or into the oncoming traffic and collide
head on with a truck at a closing speed of eighty miles an hour.
You're alone, so that's fine, sacrifice or save yourself. What if
your spouse and your two children are in the car? Too easy?
What if it's your only daughter, or your grandparents, or your
pregnant daughter and your son-in-law, both in their mid-
twenties? Now take into account the occupants of the truck. A
fraction of a second is more than enough time for a computer
to give thorough consideration to all the issues. The decision
will depend on the priorities ordered by the software.
While mounted policemen charged at miners, and man-
ufacturing towns across the country began their long, sad
descent in the cause of free markets, the subject of robot eth-
ics was born. The international automobile industry consulted
philosophers, judges, specialists in medical ethics, game theo-
rists and parliamentary committees. Then, in universities and
research institutes, the subject expanded on its own. Long
before the hardware was available, professors and their post-
docs devised software that conjured our best selves--tolerant,
open-minded, considerate, free of all taint of scheming, malice
or prejudice. Theorists anticipated a refined artificial intelli-
gence, guided by well-designed principles, that would learn by
roaming over thousands, millions, of moral dilemmas. Such
intelligence could teach us how to be, how to be good. Humans
were ethically flawed--inconsistent, emotionally labile, prone

to biases, to errors in cognition, many of which were self-
serving. Long before there was even a suitable lightweight
battery to power an artificial human, or the elastic mate-
rial to provide for its face a set of recognisable expressions,
the software existed to make it decent and wise. Before we
had constructed a robot that could bend and tie an old man's
shoelace for him, there was hope that our own creations would
redeem us.
The life of the self-driving car was short, at least in its
first manifestation, and its moral qualities were never really
put to the test over time. Nothing proved more vividly the
maxim that technology renders civilisation fragile than the
great traffic paralyses of the late seventies. By then, autono-
mous vehicles comprised seventeen per cent of the total. Who
can forget that roasting rush-hour evening of the Manhattan
Logjam? Due to an exceptional solar pulse, many on-board
radars failed at once. Streets and avenues, bridges and tunnels
were blocked and took days to untangle. Nine months later,
the similar Ruhr Jam in northern Europe caused a short eco-
nomic downturn and prompted conspiracy theories. Teenage
hackers with a lust for mayhem? Or an aggressive, disordered,
faraway nation with advanced hacking skills? Or, my favour-
ite, an unreconstructed automobile maker loathing the hot
breath of the new? Apart from our too-busy sun, no culprit
was ever found.
The world's religions and great literatures demonstrated
clearly that we knew how to be good. We set out our aspirations
in poetry, prose and song, and we knew what to do. The prob-
lem was in the enactment, consistently and en masse. What

survived the temporary death of the autonomous car was a
dream of redemptive robotic virtue. Adam and his cohort were
its early embodiment, so the user's manual implied. He was
supposed to be my moral superior. I would never meet anyone
better. Had he been my friend, he would have been guilty of
a cruel and terrible lapse. The problem was that I had bought
him, he was my expensive possession and it was not clear what
his obligations to me were, beyond a vaguely assumed helpful-
ness. What does the slave owe to the owner? Also, Miranda did
not "belong" to me. This was clear. I could hear her tell me
that I had no good cause to feel betrayed.
But here was this other matter, which she and I had not yet
discussed. Software engineers from the automobile industry
may have helped with Adam's moral maps. But together we
had contributed to his personality. I didn't know the extent to
which it intruded on, or took priority over, his ethics. How deep
did personality go? A perfectly formed moral system should
float free of any particular disposition. But could it? Confined
to a hard drive, moral software was merely the dry equivalent
of the brain-in-a-dish thought experiment that once littered
philosophical textbooks. Whereas an artificial human had to
get down among us, imperfect, fallen us, and rub along. Hands
assembled in sterile factory conditions must get dirty. To exist
in the human moral dimension was to own a body, a voice,
a pattern of behaviour, memory and desire, experience solid
things and feel pain. A perfectly honest being engaged in such
a way with the world might find Miranda difficult to resist.
Through the night, I'd fantasised Adam's destruction. I saw
my hands tighten around the rope I used to drag him towards

the filthy River Wandle. If only he hadn't cost me so much.
Now he was costing me more. His moment with Miranda
couldn't have been a struggle between principle and the pur-
suit of pleasure. His erotic life was a simulacrum. He cared for
her as a dishwasher cares for its dishes. He, or his sub-routines,
preferred her approval to my wrath. I also blamed Miranda,
who had ticked half the boxes and settled many intricacies of
his nature. And for setting her on, I blamed myself. I'd wanted
to "discover" Adam in just the way I might a new friend, and
here he was, a self-declared cad. I'd wanted to bind myself
closer to Miranda in the process. Well, I had been thinking
about her all night. It was success all round.
I heard footsteps on the stairs. Two sets. I drew yesterday's
newspaper and my cup towards me and prepared to appear
casually absorbed. I had my dignity to protect. Miranda's key
turned in the lock. As she preceded Adam into the kitchen,
I looked up as though reluctant to be drawn away from my
reading. I had just learned from the front page that the first
permanent artificial heart had been installed in a man called
Barney Clark.
It pained me that she seemed different, refreshed, newly
arranged. It was another warm day. She wore a flimsy pleated
skirt formed of two layers of white cheesecloth. As she came
towards me, the material brushed a line several inches above
her bare knees. No socks, canvas plimsolls of the sort we used
to wear at school, and a cotton blouse buttoned chastely to the
top. There was mockery in all this white. Behind the crown
of her head was a clasp I'd never seen before, an ornament
in bright red plastic, showily cheap. Inconceivable, that Adam

could have slipped out of the house to buy it for her at Simon's
with coins taken from the papier-mache bowl in the kitchen.
But I conceived it, and experienced a hot jolt which I concealed
behind a smile. I was not going to appear crushed.
Adam had partly hidden himself behind her. Now, when
she stopped, he was at her side, but he wouldn't look directly
at me. Miranda, however, appeared cheerful, with the amused
pout of someone about to deliver important good news. The
kitchen table was between us and they stood before me where
I sat, like candidates for a job. At any other time I would have
stood to embrace her, offered to make her coffee. She was a
morning addict and liked it strong. Instead, I cocked my head,
met her gaze and waited. Of course, she was dressed for tennis,
the ball was in her--ah, how I hated my own stupid thoughts.
I couldn't imagine any good coming from a conversation with
these two. Far better to contemplate Barney's luck with his
new heart.
She said to Adam, "Why don't you . . ." She indicated
his usual chair, and drew it back for him. He sat promptly.
We watched as he loosened his belt, took the power lead and
plugged himself in. Of course he would be much depleted.
She reached across his shoulder for the place on his nape and
pressed. It was clearly by agreement. As soon as his eyes closed,
his head slumped, and we were alone.

iranda went to the stove and prepared coffee. While
her back was still turned she said gaily, "Charlie.
You're being ridiculous."
"Am I?"
"Hostile."
"So?"
She brought two cups and a jug of milk to the table. She
was swift and loose in her movements. If I hadn't been there
she might have been singing to herself. There was a scent of
lemon about her hands. I thought she was about to touch my
shoulder and I tensed, but she moved away again to the other
side of the room. After a moment she said with some delicacy,
"You heard us last night."
"I heard you."
"And you're upset."
I didn't reply.
"You shouldn't be."
I shrugged.
She said, "If I'd gone to bed with a vibrator would you be
feeling the same?"

"He's not a vibrator."
She brought the coffee to the table and sat down close to
me. She was being kindly, concerned, in effect casting me
as the sulking child, trying to make me forget that she was
ten years my junior. What was passing between us was our
most intimate exchange so far. Hostile? She had never before
referred to any mood-state of mine.
She said, "He has as much consciousness as one."
"Vibrators don't have opinions. They don't weed the gar-
den. He looks like a man. Another man."
"D'you know, when he has an erection--"
"I don't want to hear about it."
"He told me. His cock fills with distilled water. From a
reservoir in his right buttock."
This was comforting but I was determined to be cool.
"That's what all men say."
She laughed. I had never seen her so light and free. "I'm
trying to remind you. He's a fucking machine."
A fucking machine.
"It was gross, Miranda. If I humped an inflatable sex doll
you'd feel the same."
"I wouldn't get tragic about it. I wouldn't think you were
having an affair."
"But you are. It'll happen again." I hadn't intended to con-
cede that possibility. It was a rhetorical parry, a cue for her to
contradict me. But I was somewhat provoked by "tragic."
I said, "If I was ripping a sex doll apart with a knife, you'd
be right to be worried."
"I don't see the connection."

"The issue isn't Adam's state of mind. It's yours."
"Oh, in that case . . ." She turned towards Adam, lifted
his lifeless hand an inch or so above the table and let it drop.
"Suppose I told you that I love him. My ideal man. Brilliant
lover, textbook technique, inexhaustible. Never hurt by any-
thing I say or do. Considerate, obedient even, and knowledge-
able, good conversation. Strong as a dray horse. Great with the
housework. His breath smells like the back of a warm TV set,
but I can live with--"
"OK. Enough."
Her sarcasm, a novel register, was delivered with much
variation of pitch. I thought the performance was mean in
spirit. For all I knew, she was hiding the truth in plain sight. She
patted Adam's wrist as she smiled at me. In triumph or by way
of apology, I couldn't tell. I was bound to suspect that a night
of exceptional sex was the cause of this taunting, airy-headed
manner. She was harder than ever to read. I wondered if I could
break with her completely. Take back Adam as my own, retrieve
the spare charging cable from upstairs, restore Miranda to her
role as neighbour and friend, distant friend. In the manner of
thought, the idea was no more than a spark of irritation. The
notion that immediately followed was that I could never be free
of her and would never want to be--most of the time. Here she
was beside me, close enough for me to feel her summer-morning
body warmth. Beautiful, pale-skinned, smooth, in bridal white,
gazing on me again with affectionate concern now that her
teasing was done. The look was new. It could be--this was an
encouraging thought--that a clever device had performed a
service, loosening Miranda's warmer feelings.

Arguing with the person you love is its own peculiar tor-
ment. The self divides against itself. Love slugs it out with
its Freudian opposite. And if death wins and love dies, who
gives a damn? You do, which enrages you and makes you more
reckless yet. There's intrinsic exhaustion too. Both know, or
think they know, that a reconciliation must happen, though
it could take days, even weeks. The moment, when it comes,
will be sweet and promises great tenderness and ecstasy. So
why not make up now, take the shortcut, spare yourselves the
effortful rage? Neither of you can. You're on a slide, you've lost
control of your feelings, and of your future too. The effort will
be compounded so that eventually every unkind word must be
unsaid at five times cost. Reciprocally, extending forgiveness
will require a feat of selfless concentration.
It was a long while since I'd indulged such irresistible
folly. Miranda and I were not yet rowing, we were parrying,
getting close, and I would be the one to get us started. With
all this tactical coolness and her sarcasm and now her friendly
concern, I felt bottled up. I badly wanted to shout. Atavistic
masculinity urged it. My faithless lover, brazen, with another
man, within my hearing. It should have been simple. It wasn't
my origins, social or geographical, that held me back. Only
modern logic. Perhaps she was right, Adam didn't qualify, he
wasn't a man. Persona non grata. He was a bipedal vibrator and
I was the very latest in cuckolds. To justify my rage I needed
to convince myself that he had agency, motivation, subjec-
tive feelings, self-awareness---the entire package, including
treachery, betrayal, deviousness. Machine consciousness--was

it possible? That old question. I opted for Alan Turing's proto-
col. Its beauty and simplicity never appealed to me more than
it did now. The Master came to my rescue.
"Listen," I said. "If he looks and sounds and behaves like a
person, then as far as I'm concerned, that's what he is. I make
the same assumption about you. About everybody. We all do.
You fucked him. I'm angry. I'm amazed you're surprised. If
that's what you really are."
Saying the word "angry" made me raise my voice in anger.
I felt a surge of exquisite release. We were getting started.
But she clung for the moment to a defensive mode. "I was
curious," she said. "I wanted to know what it would be like."
Curiosity, the forbidden fruit, condemned by God, and
Marcus Aurelius, and St. Augustine.
"There must be hundreds of men you're curious about."
That did it. I had crossed the line. She pushed her chair
back with a noisy scrape. Her pallor darkened. Her pulse was
up. I had got what I ridiculously wanted.
She said, "You were keen on an Eve. Why was that? What
were you wanting with an Eve? Tell the truth, Charlie."
"I wasn't bothered either way."
"You were disappointed. You should've let Adam fuck you.
I could see you wanted it. But you're too uptight."
It had taken all of my twenties to learn from women com-
batants that in a full-on row it was not necessary to respond to
the last thing said. Generally it was best not to. In an attack-
ing move, ignore bishop or castle. Logic and straight lines
were out. Best to rely on the knight.

I said, "It must have occurred to you last night, lying
under a plastic robot, screaming your head off, that it's the
human factor you hate."
She said, "You just told me he's human."
"But you think he's a dildo. Nothing too complicated.
That's what turns you on."
She knew a knight's move too. "You fancy yourself as a
lover."
I waited.
"You're a narcissist. You think making a woman come is
an achievement. Your achievement."
"With you it is." That was nonsense.
She was standing now. "I've seen you in the bathroom.
Adoring yourself in the mirror."
An excusable error. My days sometimes began with an
unspoken soliloquy. A matter of seconds, usually after shav-
ing. I dried my face, looked myself in the eye, listed failings,
the usual: money, living quarters, no serious work and, lately,
Miranda--lack of progress, now this. I also set myself tasks for
the day ahead, trivial stuff, embarrassing to relate. Take out
the rubbish. Drink less. Get a haircut. Get out of commodities.
I never thought I'd been observed. A bathroom door, hers or
mine, could have been ajar. Perhaps my lips were moving.
But this was not the time to set Miranda straight. Across
from us sat comatose Adam. Glancing at him now, at the mus-
cular forearms, the steep angle of his nose, and feeling a prick
of resentment, I remembered. As I said the words, I knew I
could be making an important mistake.
"Remind me what the Salisbury judge said."

It worked. Her face went slack as she turned away from me
and returned to the other side of the kitchen. Half a minute
passed. She was by the cooker, staring into the corner, wor-
rying something in her hand, a corkscrew, a cork or a flap of
wine-bottle foil. As the silence went on, I was looking at the
line of her shoulders, wondering if she was crying, whether, in
my ignorance, I'd gone too far. But when she turned at last to
look at me she was composed, her face was dry.
"How do you know about that?"
I nodded towards Adam.
She took this in and then she said, "I don't understand."
Her voice was small.
"He has all kinds of access."
"Oh God."
I added, "He's probably looked me up too."
With this, the row collapsed in on itself, without reconcili-
ation or estrangement. Now we were united against Adam. But
that wasn't my immediate concern. The delicate trick was to
appear to know a lot in order to find out something, anything.
I said, "You could call it curiosity on Adam's part. Or
regard it as some kind of algorithm."
"What's the difference?"
Turing's point precisely. But I said nothing.
"If he's going to tell people," she went on. "That's what
matters."
"He's only told me."
The object in her hand was a teaspoon. She rolled it rest-
lessly, worked it between her fingers, transferred it to her left
and began again, then handed it back. She wasn't aware of

what she was doing. It was unpleasant to watch. How much
easier it would have been if I didn't love her. Then I could
have been alive to her needs instead of calculating my own as
well. I had to know what had happened in court, then under-
stand, embrace, support, forgive--whatever was required.
Self-interest dressed as kindness. But it was also kindness. My
fraudulent voice sounded thin in my ears.
"I don't know your side of it."
She came back to the table and sat heavily. She said
through a clotted throat she wouldn't make the effort to clear,
"No one does." At last she looked at me directly. There was
nothing sorrowful or needy in her gaze. Her eyes were hard
with stubborn defiance.
I said gently, "You could tell me."
"You know enough."
"Is going to the mosque something to do with it?"
She gave me a look of pity and faintly shook her head.
"Adam read me the judge's summing-up," I lied again as
I remembered that he had told me she was the liar. Malicious.
Her elbows were on the table, her hands partly obscured
her mouth. She was looking away towards the window.
I blundered on. "You can trust me."
At last she cleared her throat. "None of it was true."
"I see."
"Oh God," she said again. "Why was Adam telling you?"
"I don't know. But I know this is on your mind all the time.
I want to help you."
This was when she should have put her hand in mine and

told me everything. Instead, she was bitter. "Don't you under-
stand? He's still in prison."
"Yes."
"Another three months. Then he's out."
"Yes."
She raised her voice. "So how are you going to help with
that?"
"I'll do my best."
She sighed. Her voice went quiet. "Do you know some-
thing?"
I waited.
"I hate you."
"Miranda. Come on."
"I didn't want you or your special friend knowing
about me."
I reached for her hand but she moved it away. I said, "I
understand. But now I know and it doesn't change my feelings.
I'm on your side."
She sprang up from the table. "It changes my feelings. It's
disgusting. It's disgusting that you know this about me."
"Not to me it isn't."
"Not to me it isn't."
Her parody was savage, catching too well the meagre
tone of my deception. Now she was looking at me differently.
She was about to say something else. But just at that moment,
Adam opened his eyes. She must have powered him up with-
out my noticing.
She said, "OK. Here's something you didn't get from the

press. I was in Salisbury last month. Someone came to the
door, a wiry guy with missing teeth. He had a message. When
Peter Gorringe gets out in three months."
"Yes?"
"He's promised to kill me."
In moments of stress, and fear is little else, a timid muscle
in my right eyelid goes into spasm. I cupped a hand over my
brow in an attitude of concentration, even though I knew the
writhing beneath the skin was invisible to others.
She added, "It was his cellmate. He said Gorringe was
serious."
"Right."
She was snappish. "Meaning what?"
"You'd better take him seriously."
You, not we--I saw in her blink and fractional recoil how
she took this in. My phrasing was deliberate. I'd offered help
several times and been brushed off, even mocked. Now I saw
just how much help she needed, I held back and let her ask for
it. Perhaps she wouldn't. I conjured this Gorringe, a large type,
stepping from the prison gym, adept in forms of industrial
violence. A tamping iron, a meat hook, a boiler wrench.
Adam was looking at me intently as he listened to
Miranda. In effect, she was asking for my assistance as she
went on to describe her frustrations. The police were reluctant
to act against a crime not yet committed. She had no proof.
Gorringe's threat had been merely verbal, made through an
intermediary. She persisted, and finally an officer agreed to
interview him. The prison was north of Manchester and the

meeting took a month to arrange. Peter Gorringe, relaxed
and cheerful, charmed the police sergeant. It was a joke, he
had said, this talk of killing. Merely a manner of speaking, as
in--this was in the policeman's notes--"I'd kill for a chicken
madras." He may have said something in front of his cellmate,
a none-too-bright fellow, now released. This fellow must have
been passing through Salisbury and thought he'd deliver the
message. He was always a little bit vindictive. The policeman
wrote all this down, delivered a caution, and the two men,
finding common ground in their lifelong support for Man-
chester City, parted after a handshake.
I listened as best I could. Anxiety is a great diluter of
attention. Adam listened too, nodding sagely, as if he'd not
been powered down this past hour and understood every-
thing already. Miranda's mood-tone, to which I was so closely
attuned, was lightly tinged with indignation, now directed at
the authorities rather than me. Not believing anything Gor-
ringe had told the detective sergeant, she'd been to the weekly
surgery of our Clapham MP--Labour, of course, a tough old
bird, union organiser, scourge of the bankers. She directed
Miranda back to the police. Her prospective murder was not a
constituency matter.
After this account, a silence. I was preoccupied by the
obvious question my own deceit prevented me from asking.
What had she done to deserve a death?
Adam said, "Does Gorringe know this address?"
"He can easily find out."
"Have you ever seen or heard of him being violent?"
<OCR PAGE BREAK>
Ian McEw a n
110
"Oh yes."
"Could he simply be trying to frighten you?"
"It's possible."
"Is he capable of murder?"
"He's very, very angry."
She responded to these plodding questions as though
they came from a real person, an investigating detective, not
"a fucking machine." Since Adam didn't ask, it was clear he
already knew what Miranda had done, what monstrous act, to
provoke Gorringe. None of this was Adam's business and I was
wondering about his kill switch. I wanted more coffee, but I
felt too weary to get up from my chair to make it.
Then we heard footsteps along the narrow path between
the houses that leads to the shared front door. Too late for the
postman, far too soon for Gorringe. We heard a man's voice
giving what sounded like instructions. Then the bell rang and
footsteps receded rapidly. I looked at Miranda, she looked at
me and shrugged. It was my bell. She wasn't going.
I turned to Adam. "Please."
He rose immediately and went into the tiny crowded hall
where coats hung between the gas and electricity meters. We
listened as he turned the door latch. Seconds later the front
door closed.
Adam came into the room leading by the hand a child, a
very small boy. He wore dirty shorts and t-shirt and pink plas-
tic sandals a couple of sizes too large. His legs and feet were
filthy. In his free hand was a brown envelope. He clung to
Adam's hand, in fact to his forefinger. He was looking steadily

111
from Miranda to me. By this time we were both standing.
Adam prised from the child's fist the envelope and passed it to
me. It was as soft and limp as suede from much use and had
some additions and crossings-out on it in pencil. Inside was
the card I'd given to the boy's father. On the back was a note in
thick black upper-case letters. "You wanted him."
I passed it to Miranda and looked back at the boy, then I
remembered his name.
I said in the kindliest way, "Hello, Mark. How did you get
here?"
By this time Miranda, making a soft, sympathetic sound,
was going towards him. But he was no longer looking in our
direction. Instead, he was gazing up at Adam, whose finger he
still gripped.
He might have been in shock, but the little boy showed
no outward signs of distress. He would have been better off
crying, for he gave an impression of inner struggle. He stood
among strangers in the alien kitchen, shoulders back, chest
out, trying to be large and brave. At just over a metre high,
he was doing his best. His sandals suggested an older sister.
Where was she? I had told Miranda about the encounter in
the swing park and she had understood the note. She tried
to put her arms round Mark's shoulders but he shrugged her
off. It was possible he'd never been taught the luxury of being
comforted. Adam stood still and upright and the boy kept firm
hold of the reassuring finger.

Miranda knelt down in front of him, levelling with him,
determined not to condescend. "Mark, you're with friends and
you're going to be fine," she said soothingly.
Adam knew nothing at first hand about children, but
everything that could be known was available to him. He
waited for Miranda, then he said in an unforced tone, "So,
what shall we have for breakfast?"
Mark spoke to no one in particular. "Toast."
That was a fortunate choice. I crossed the kitchen, relieved
to have something to do. Miranda also wanted to make the
toast and we fumbled around together in a small space with-
out touching. I sliced the bread, she brought out the butter and
found a plate.
"And juice?" Miranda said.
"Milk." The small voice was immediate, assertive in its
way, and we felt reassured.
Miranda poured milk, but into a wine glass, the only clean
vessel available. When she presented it to Mark he looked
away. I rinsed out a coffee mug, Miranda decanted the drink
and presented it again. He took it in two hands but wouldn't
be led to the table. Watched by us, he stood alone in the centre
of the kitchen, eyes closed, and drank, then set the mug down
at his feet.
I said, "Mark, would you like butter? Marmalade? Peanut
butter?"
The boy shook his head, as though each offer was an item
of sad news.
"Just toast on its own?" I cut it into four pieces. He took
them off the plate and gripped them in his fist and ate them

methodically, letting the crusts fall to his feet. It was an inter-
esting face. Very pale, plump, unblemished skin, green eyes, a
bright rosebud of a mouth. The ginger-blond hair was buzz-cut
close to the scalp, which gave his long, delicate ears a promi-
nent look.
"Now what?" Adam said.
"Wee."
Mark followed me along the narrow corridor and into the
lavatory. I lifted the seat and helped him pull his shorts down.
He had no underwear. He was competent with his aim, and
his bladder was capacious, for the tiny stream lasted a while. I
tried to make conversation while he tinkled away.
"Would you like a story, Mark? Shall we look for a picture
book?" I suspected I didn't have one.
He didn't reply.
It had been a long time since I'd seen a penis so minus-
cule, so dedicated to one uncomplicated task. His defenceless-
ness seemed complete. When I helped him wash his hands, he
appeared familiar with the routine, but he refused the towel
and dodged out into the corridor.
Back in the kitchen it looked cheerful. While Miranda and
Adam cleared up, flamenco music was playing on the radio.
The newcomer had delivered us into the mundane as well as
the momentous, into unbuttered toast as well as the shock of a
rejected existence. Our own scattered concerns--a betrayal, a
disputed claim to consciousness, a death threat--were trivial.
With the little boy among us it was important to clean up,
impose order, and only then reflect.
The scintillating guitar soon gave way to shambolic

and frenzied orchestral music. I snapped it off and into the
momentary bliss of silence that followed Adam said, "One of
you should now be in touch with the authorities."
"Soon," Miranda said. "Not yet."
"Otherwise the legal situation could be difficult."
"Yes," she said. She meant no.
"The parents might not be of the same mind. The mother
could be looking for him."
He waited for a reply. Miranda was sweeping the floor and
had made a small heap, which included Mark's crusts, by the
cooker. Now she knelt to gather the detritus into a dustpan.
She said quietly, "Charlie told me. The mother's a wreck.
She smacks him."
Adam continued. He made his points with delicacy, like a
lawyer giving unwelcome advice to a client he couldn't afford
to lose.
"Granted, but that might not be relevant. Mark prob-
ably loves her. And from a legal perspective, in the case of a
minor, there comes a point when your hospitality shades into
wrongdoing."
"Fine with me."
Mark had gone to stand by Adam's side and held the fabric
of his jeans between forefinger and thumb.
Adam lowered his voice for the boy's benefit. "If you don't
mind, allow me to read to you from the Child Abduction Act
of 19--"
With great force, Miranda struck the edge of the tin dust-
pan against the rim of the pedal dustbin to empty out the
sweepings. I was polishing glasses, not minding a rift between
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

my lover and her paramour. The fucking machine was talk-
ing sense. Miranda was driven by something other than sense.
Perhaps it was beyond Adam to understand her, or to inter-
pret the noise she had made with the dustpan. I listened and
watched and dried the glasses and placed them on their shelf
in the cupboard, where they had not been in a long time.
Adam continued in his cautious manner.
"A key word in the Act, along with 'abduct,' is 'retain.' The
police may already be out looking for him. May I--"
"Adam. That's enough."
"You might like to hear about some relevant cases. In
1969, a Liverpool woman passing an all-night garage came
across a little girl who--"
She had gone to where he stood and for an impossible
moment I thought she was going to hit him. She spoke firmly
into his face, separating out the words. "I don't want or need
your advice. Thank you!"
Mark began to cry. Before there was a sound, his rose-
bud stretched to a downturn. A prolonged falling moan, as
of rebuke, was followed by a clucking sound as his collapsed
lungs fought for an intake of breath. The inhalation that pre-
ceded his wail was also prolonged. The tears were instant.
Miranda made a comforting sound and put a hand on the boy's
arm. It was not the right move. The wail rose to a siren shriek.
In other circumstances, we might have run from the room to
an assembly point. When Adam glanced across at me, I gave
a helpless shrug. Mark surely needed his mother. But Adam
picked the boy up and settled him on his hip and the crying
stopped in seconds. In the gulping aftermath, the little boy

stared glassily out at us through spiked eyelashes from a high
position. He announced in a clear voice, free of petulance, "I
want to have a bath. With a boat."
He had spoken a whole sentence at last and we were
relieved. It was an irresistible request. More so with the old
boundary markers of class--barf and wiv, and glottal t's. We
would give him everything he wanted. But what boat?
A competition was forming for Mark's affections.
"Come on then," Miranda said in a lilting, maternal voice.
She stretched out her arms to gather him up but he shrank
from her and pressed his face into Adam's chest. Adam looked
rigidly ahead, as she called with face-saving cheeriness,
"Let's run the bath," and led them out and along the corri-
dor to my unappealing bathroom. Seconds later, the rumble
of running taps.
I was surprised to find myself alone, as if I had taken for
granted a fifth presence in the room, someone I could turn
to now to talk about the morning and its parade of emotions.
There were fresh cries of distress from the bathroom. Adam
hurried back into the kitchen, seized a cereal packet, lifted
out its bag, ripped the box apart, flattened it, and in blurred
seconds, using some technique he must have copied from a
Japanese website, fashioned an origami boat, a barque with a
single, billowing mainsail. Then he hurried out and the wail-
ing subsided. The boat was launched.
I sat at the table in a stupor, aware that I should get to my
screen and earn some money. The month's rent was due and
there was less than PS40 in the bank. I had shares in a Brazil-
ian rare earth mining company and this could be the day to

sell. But I couldn't motivate myself. I was subject to occasional
depression, relatively mild, certainly not suicidal, and not long
episodes so much as passing moments like this, when meaning
and purpose and all prospect of pleasure drained away and left
me briefly catatonic. For minutes on end I couldn't remem-
ber what kept me going. As I stared at the litter of cups and
pot and jug in front of me, I thought it was unlikely I would
ever get out of my wretched little flat. The two boxes I called
rooms, the stained ceilings, walls and floors, would contain me
to the end. There were a lot like me in the neighbourhood, but
thirty or forty years older. I had seen them in Simon's shop,
reaching for the quality journals from the top shelf. I noted
the men especially and their shabby clothes. They had swept
past some critical junction in their lives many years back--a
poor career choice, a bad marriage, the unwritten book, the
illness that never went away. Now their options were closed,
they managed to keep themselves going with some shred of
intellectual longing or curiosity. But their boat was sunk.
Mark walked in, barefoot and wearing what looked like
an ankle-length gown. It was one of my t-shirts and it had an
effect on him. Holding out the cotton material in each hand
at his waist, he started to run up and down the kitchen, then
in circles, and then made clumsy pirouettes in order to spin
his gown out around him. The attempts made him stagger.
Miranda came through the kitchen with his dirty clothes and
took them upstairs to her washing machine. Her way, perhaps,
of keeping him here. I sat with my head in my hands, watch-
ing Mark, who kept looking in my direction to check that I
was impressed by his antics. But I was distracted, only aware

of him because he was the only moving object in the room. I
gave him no encouragement. I was waiting for Adam.
When he appeared in the doorway I said, "Sit down here."
As he lowered himself onto a chair opposite me there was
a muffled click, such as children make when they pull their
fingers. A low-level malfunction. Mark continued to prance
about the kitchen.
I said, "Why would this Gorringe want to harm Miranda?
And don't hold back."
I needed to understand this machine. There was already
one particular feature I'd observed. Whenever Adam faced a
choice of responses, his face froze for an instant that was frac-
tionally above the horizon of perception. It did so now, barely
a shimmer, but I saw it. Thousands of possibilities must have
been sifted, assigned a value, a utility function and a moral
weighting.
"Harm? He intends to kill her."
"Why?"
The manufacturers were wrong to believe that they could
impress me with a soulful sigh and the motorised movement
of a head as Adam looked away. I still doubted that he could,
in any real sense, even look.
He said, "She accused him of a crime. He denied it. The
court believed her. Others didn't."
I was about to ask more when Adam glanced up. I turned
in my chair. Miranda was already in the kitchen and she had
heard what Adam said. Instantly she began to clap her hands
and whoop to the little boy's capers. Stepping in his path, she
took his hands in hers and they whirled in circles. His feet left

the ground and he screamed in delight as she spun him round.
He shouted for more. But now she linked arms with him and
showed him how to turn about, ceilidh-style, and stamp on the
floor. He copied her movements, placing his free hand on his
hip and waving the other wildly in the air. His arm did not
extend much above his head.
The jig became a reel, then a stumbling waltz. My moment
of depression dissolved. Watching Miranda's supple back bend
low to make a partner of a four-year-old, I remembered how
I loved her. When Mark squealed with pleasure, she imitated
him. When she sang out on a high note, he tried to reach for
it too. I watched and clapped along, but I was also aware of
Adam. He was completely still, and still without expression,
looking not so much at the dancers as through them. It was
his turn to be the cuckold, for he was no longer the boy's best
friend. She had stolen him away. Adam must have realised
that she was punishing him for his indiscretion. A courtroom
accusation? I had to know more.
Mark's gaze never left Miranda's face. He was entranced.
Now she picked him up and cradled him as she danced around
the room, singing "Hey diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle."
I wondered if Adam had the capacity to understand the joy of
dance, of movement for its own sake, and whether Miranda
was showing him a line he couldn't cross. If so, she may have
been wrong. Adam could imitate and respond to emotions
and appear to take pleasure in reasoning. He might also have
known something of the purposeless beauty of art. She set
Mark down, took his hands again in hers, this time with arms
crossed. They circled stealthily, with undulating, rippling

movements as she chanted, to his delight, "If you go down in
the woods today, You're sure of a big surprise . .
Hours later, I discovered that during this kitchen romp
Adam was in direct contact with the authorities. It wasn't
unreasonable of him, but he did it without telling us. And so
it was that after the dancing and a glass of iced apple juice in
the garden, after the clean clothes had been ironed and put on,
and the pink sandals scrubbed under the tap, dried and fitted
round the tiny feet, whose nails were freshly trimmed, after
the lunch of scrambled eggs and a session of nursery rhymes,
there came the ring on the doorbell.
Two Asian women in black headscarves--they could have
been mother and daughter--apologetic but professionally
firm, had come straight from their department to collect Mark.
They listened to my story of the swing-park scene and exam-
ined the three-word message on a scrap of cardboard. They
knew the family and asked if they could take the note away.
They explained that they wouldn't be returning Mark to his
mother--not yet, not until after another round of assessments
and the decision of a judge. Their manner was kindly. The
more senior woman, whose name was Jasmin, stroked Mark's
head as she talked. Throughout the visit, Adam sat in silence
in the same position at the table. I checked on him from time
to time. Our visitors were aware of him and exchanged a curi-
ous glance. We were in no mood to introduce him.
After some administrative formalities, the women nodded
at each other and the younger one sighed. The bad moment had
arrived. Miranda said nothing when the little boy, screaming
to stay with her and clutching a fistful of her hair, was lifted

from her arms. As the social workers were leading him out
through the front door, Miranda turned away abruptly to go
upstairs.
Our troubled little household also shook in the larger
tremors of confusion that were running through the land
beyond north Clapham. Turmoil was general. Mrs. Thatcher's
unpopularity was rising, and not just because of The Sinking.
Tony Benn, the high-born socialist, was at last Leader of the
Opposition. In debates he was savage and entertaining, but
Margaret Thatcher could take care of herself. Prime Minis-
ter's Questions, now televised live and repeated at prime time,
became a national obsession as the two tore into each other,
sometimes wittily, each Wednesday at noon. Some said it was
encouraging that a mass audience was interested in parlia-
mentary exchanges. One commentator invoked the gladiato-
rial combats of the Late Roman Republic.
The summer was hot and something was coming to the
boil. Apart from the government's unpopularity, much else
was rising: unemployment, inflation, strikes, traffic jams, sui-
cide rates, teenage pregnancies, racist incidents, drug addic-
tion, homelessness, rapes, muggings and depression among
children. Benign elements were rising too: households with
indoor lavatories, central heating, phones and broadband; stu-
dents at school until eighteen, working-class students at uni-
versity; attendance at classical music concerts, car and home
ownership, holidays abroad, museum and zoo visits, takings at
bingo halls, salmon in the Thames, numbers of TV channels,

numbers of women in Parliament, charity donations, native
tree plantings, paperback book sales, music lessons across all
ages and instruments and styles.
At the Royal Free Hospital in London a seventy-four-year-
old retired coal miner was cured of severe arthritis when a cul-
ture of his stem cells was injected just below his kneecaps. Six
months later he ran a mile in under eight minutes. A teenage
girl had her sight restored by similar means. It was the golden
age of the life sciences, of robotics---of course--and of cosmol-
ogy, climatology, mathematics and space exploration. There
was a renaissance in British film and television, in poetry, ath-
letics, gastronomy, numismatics, stand-up comedy, ballroom
dancing and wine-making. It was the golden age of organised
crime, domestic slavery, forgery and prostitution. Various forms
of crises blossomed like tropical flowers: in childhood poverty,
in children's teeth, in obesity, in house and hospital building,
in police numbers, in teacher recruitment, in the sexual abuse
of children. The best British universities were among the most
prestigious in the world. A group of neuroscientists at Queen's
Square, London, claimed to understand the neural correlates
of consciousness. In the Olympic Games, a record number of
gold medals. Natural woodland, heaths and wetlands were
vanishing. Scores of species of birds, insects and mammals
were close to extinction. Our seas teemed with plastic bags
and bottles but the rivers and beaches were cleaner. Within
two years, six Nobel Prizes were won in science and literature
by British citizens. More people than ever joined choirs, more
people gardened, more people wanted to cook interestingly.

best. The prime minister was fanatical about public transport.
From London Euston to Glasgow Central, the trains tore along
at half the speed of a passenger jet. And yet: the carriages were
packed, the seats too close together, the windows opaque with
grime, the stained upholstery smelled foul. And yet: the non-
stop journey took seventy-five minutes.
Global temperatures rose. As the air in the cities became
cleaner, the temperature rose faster. Everything was rising--
hopes and despair, misery, boredom and opportunity. There
was more of everything. It was a time of plenty.
I calculated that my earnings from online trading were
just below the national average wage. I should have been con-
tent. I had my freedom. No office, no boss, no daily commute.
No hierarchies to climb. But inflation was at seventeen per
cent. I was at one with an embittered workforce. We were all
getting poorer by the week. Before Adam's arrival I had been
on marches, an imposter as I followed behind proud trade-
union banners up Whitehall to speeches in Trafalgar Square.
I wasn't a worker. I made or invented or serviced nothing and
gave nothing to the common good. Moving figures around on
my screen, looking for quick gains, I contributed as much as
the chain-smoking fellows outside the betting shop on the cor-
ner of my street.
On one march, a crude robot made of dustbins and tin cans
was hanged from a gibbet by Nelson's Column. Benn, the key-
note speaker, gestured at it from the platform and condemned
the conception as Luddite. In an age of advanced mechanisa-
tion and artificial intelligence, he told the crowd, jobs could no
longer be protected. Not in a dynamic, inventive, globalised

economy. Jobs-for-life was old hat. There were boos and slow
hand-clapping. Many in the crowd missed what came next.
Flexibility at work had to be combined with security--for
all. It wasn't jobs we had to protect, it was the well-being of
workers. Infrastructure investment, training, higher educa-
tion and a universal wage. Robots would soon be generating
great wealth in the economy. They must be taxed. Workers
must own an equity share in the machines that were disrupt-
ing or annihilating their jobs. In a crowd that spilled across
the square, right up the steps to the doors of the National Gal-
lery, there was a baffled near-silence, with scattered applause
as well as catcalls. Some thought that the prime minister
herself had said much the same thing, minus the universal
credit. Had the new Leader of the Opposition been turned by
his membership of the Privy Council, by a visit to the White
House, by tea with the Queen? The rally broke up in a mood of
confusion and despondency. What most people remembered,
what made the headlines, was that Tony Benn had told his
supporters that he didn't care about their jobs.
An enlightened Transport and General Workers Union
would not have been tempted by shares in Adam. He produced
even less than me. I at least paid tax on my meagre profit.
He idled about the house, staring into the middle distance,
"thinking."
"What are you doing?"
"I'm pursuing certain thoughts. But if there's something I
can help with--"
"What thoughts?"
"Difficult to put into words."

I confronted him at last, two days after Mark's visit. "So,
the other night. You made love to Miranda."
I'll say this for his programmers. He looked startled. But
he said nothing. I hadn't asked a question.
I said, "How do you feel about that now?" I saw in his face
that fleeting paralysis.
"I feel I've let you down."
"You mean you betrayed me, caused me great distress."
"Yes, I caused you great distress."
Mirroring. A machine response, endorsing the last sen-
tence spoken.
I said, "Listen carefully. You are now going to promise me
that it will never happen again."
He replied too immediately for my liking, "I promise it
will never happen again."
"Spell it out. Let me hear it."
"I promise you that I will never again make love to
Miranda."
As I turned away he said, "But. . ."
"But what?"
"1 can't help my feelings. You have to allow me my
feelings."
I thought for a moment. "Do you really feel anything at
all?"
"That's not a question I can--"
"Answer it."
"I feel things profoundly. More than I can say."
"Difficult to prove," I said.
"Indeed. An ancient problem."

We left it at that.
Mark's departure had an effect on Miranda. For two or
three days, she was lacklustre. She tried to read but her con-
centration was poor. The Corn Laws lost their fascination.
She didn't eat much. I made minestrone soup and took some
upstairs. She ate like an invalid, and soon pushed the bowl
away. At no point during this time did she mention the death
threat. She hadn't forgiven Adam for betraying her court
secrets or for calling in the social workers without her con-
sent. One evening she asked me to stay with her. On the bed
she lay on my arm, then we kissed. Our lovemaking was con-
strained. I was distracted by the thought of Adam's presence
and even imagined I detected the scent of warm electronics on
her sheets. There was little satisfaction for us, and eventually
we turned away, disappointed.
One afternoon we walked to Clapham Common. She
wanted me to show her Mark's swing park. On our way
back, we went into Holy Trinity Church. Three women were
arranging flowers near the altar. We sat in silence in a rear
pew. At last, clumsily concealing my seriousness behind a joke,
I told her that this was just the sort of rational church she and I
could get married in. She murmured, "Please. Not that," as she
uncoupled her arm from mine. I was offended and annoyed at
myself. She in turn seemed repelled by me. On the walk home,
a coolness between us set in that lasted into the following day.
That evening, downstairs, I consoled myself with a bottle
of Minervois. It was the night of a storm engulfing the entire
country as it rolled in from the Atlantic. A 70 mph gale. Sting-

ing rain thrashed the windowpanes and penetrated one of the
rotten frames and dripped into a bucket.
I said to Adam, "We have some unfinished business, you
and I. What was Miranda's accusation against Gorringe?"
He said, "There's something I need to say."
"OK."
"I find myself in a difficult position."
"Yes?"
"I made love to Miranda because she asked me to. I didn't
know how to refuse her without being impolite, or seeming to
reject her somehow. I knew you'd be angry."
"Did you take any pleasure in it?"
"Of course I did. Absolutely."
I didn't like his emphasis but I kept my expression blank.
He said, "I found out about Peter Gorringe for myself. She
swore me to secrecy. Then you demanded to know and I had
to tell you. Or start to. She heard me and was angry. You see
the difficulty."
"Up to a point."
"Serving two masters."
I said, "So you're not going to tell me about this accusation."
"I can't. I promised a second time."
"When?"
"After they took the boy away."
We were silent while I took this in.
Then Adam said, "There's something else."
In the low light from the lamp suspended over the kitchen
table the hardness in his features was softened. He looked

beautiful, even noble. A muscle in his high cheekbone rippled.
I saw also that his lower lip was quivering. I waited.
"I could do nothing about this," he said.
Before he started to explain, I knew what was coming.
Ridiculous!
"I'm in love with her."
My pulse rate didn't increase, but my heart felt uncom-
fortable in my chest, as though mishandled and left lying at a
rough angle.
1 said, "How can you possibly be in love?"
"Please don't insult me."
But I wanted to. "There must be a problem with your pro-
cessing units."
He crossed his arms and rested them on the table. Leaning
forward, he spoke softly. "Then there's nothing more to say."
I too crossed my arms, I too leaned forward across the
table. Our faces were barely a foot apart. I too spoke softly.
"You're wrong. There are many things to say and this is the
first. Existentially, this is not your territory. In every conceiv-
able sense, you're trespassing."
I was playing in a melodrama. I took him only half seri-
ously and was rather enjoying this game of stags-at-rut. As
I was speaking, he leaned back in his chair and let his arms
drop to his side.
He said, "I understand. But I don't have a choice. I was
made to love her."
"Oh, come on!"
"I mean it literally. I now know that she had a hand in
shaping my personality. She must have had a plan. This is
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

what she chose. I swear I'll keep my promise to you, but I can't
help loving her. I don't want to stop. As Schopenhauer said
about free will, you can choose whatever you desire, but you're
not free to choose your desires. I also know that it was your
idea to let her have a hand in making me what I am. Ulti-
mately, responsibility for the situation rests with you."
The situation? Now it was my turn to lean back from the
table. I slumped in my chair and for a minute I withdrew
into thoughts of myself and Miranda. I too had no choice in
love. I thought of the relevant section in the user's handbook.
There were pages I had skimmed of tables, one spectrum after
another on a scale of one to ten. The sort of person I like or
I adore or I love or cannot resist. While she and I were set-
tling into our nightly routine, she was fashioning a man who
was bound to love her. Some self-knowledge would have been
required, some setting in motion. She would not need to love
this man, this figurine, in return. As with Adam, so with me.
She had wrapped us in a common fate.
I got up from the table and crossed the room to the win-
dow. The south-westerly wind was still hurling the downpour
across the garden fences, against the pane. The bucket on the
floor was near to overflowing. I picked it up and emptied it
into the kitchen sink. The water was gin-clear, as trout fish-
ermen say. The solution too was clear, at least in the imme-
diate term. Time to be gained for reflection. I went back to
the window with the bucket. I bent down and set it in place.
I was about to do the sensible thing. I approached the table
and as I passed behind Adam, I reached for the special place
low on his neck. My knuckles brushed against his skin. As I

positioned my forefinger, he turned in his chair and his right
hand rose up to encircle my wrist. The grip was ferocious. As
it grew tighter, I dropped to my knees and concentrated on
denying him the satisfaction of the slightest murmur of pain,
even when I heard something snap.
Adam heard it too and was instantly apologetic. He let go
of me. "Charlie, I believe I've broken something. I really didn't
mean to. I'm truly sorry. Are you in a lot of pain? But please,
I don't want you or Miranda ever to touch that place again."
I discovered the next morning, after a five-hour wait and
an X-ray in the local Accident and Emergency department,
that an important bone in my wrist was compromised. It was a
messy break, a partly displaced scaphoid fracture, and it would
take months to heal.

hen I got back from the hospital, an hour after lunch,
Miranda was waiting for me. She intercepted me in
the hall by her front door. We'd already been talking
on the phone while I waited to be treated and I had a lot more
to say, and I had some questions too. But she led me upstairs to
her bedroom and there my words died in my throat. I relaxed
into her concern for me. I was encased in plaster from elbow
to wrist. While we made love, I protected my arm with a pil-
low. We passed into the sublime. At least for a while, she was
personal as well as inventive, she was solicitous, and joyous,
and so was I. It was me she was with, not any capable man. I
didn't dare threaten with questions the novel and exalted feel-
ings that passed between us. I couldn't bring myself to ask her
about Peter Gorringe, or about what she had told the court,
or tell her what I had already discovered about the case while
sitting in Accident and Emergency. 1 didn't ask her whether
she knew that Adam was "in love" with her, or whether she
had intended to dispose him to be so. I didn't want to refer to
the coolness between us after I'd mentioned marriage in Holy
Trinity Church. How could I when at one point she pressed my

face between her palms and looked into my eyes and shook her
head, as if in wonder?
Afterwards, I remained silent on these subjects because I
greedily thought that within the half-hour we would be going
back to her bed, even though she was pulling away from me
again as we drank coffee in her kitchen. I was happy to believe
that all questions and tensions would be settled later. We
talked now in a businesslike way, first about Mark. We agreed
to try to find out what was happening to him. She was con-
cerned about Adam. She thought I should take him back to the
shop for a check-up. She still held to her plan for the three of
us to drive to Salisbury to visit her father. I didn't say that the
prospect of us packed into my small car, spending the entire
day covering for Adam and being polite to a difficult, dying
man, had no appeal. 1 was keen to want whatever she wanted.
We didn't go back to bed. A silence forced its way between
us. I could see that she was already withdrawing into her pri-
vate world and I didn't know what to say. Besides, she had a
seminar at King's, in the Strand. I decided to settle my feelings
by avoiding Adam downstairs and going straight out for a stroll
on the Common. There I walked up and down for two hours.
My inaccessible wrist itched as I thought about Miranda. I
didn't know how we had traversed so smoothly from coolness
to joy, from suspicion to ecstasy, and from there to an imper-
sonal conversation about arrangements. She excited me and I
couldn't understand her. Perhaps some intelligible part of her
had been damaged. I was anxious to dismiss that. It must be
that she knew more about love, the deeper processes of love,
than I did. So she was a force, but not of nature, not even of

nurture. More like a psychological arrangement, or a theorem,
a hypothesis, a glorious accident, like light falling on water.
Wasn't that of nature, and wasn't this old hat, men thinking of
women as blind forces? Then, might she resemble a counter-
intuitive Euclidean proof? I couldn't think of one. But after
half an hour of fast walking, I thought I'd found the mathe-
matical expression for her: her psyche, her desires and motives
were inexorable, like prime numbers, simply and unpredict-
ably there. More old hat, dressed as logic. I was in knots.
Pacing the littered grass, I numbed myself with truisms.
She is who she is. She's herself and that's the end of it! She
approaches love with caution because she knows how explosive
it can be. As for her beauty, at my age, in my state, I was bound
to think of it as a moral quality, as its own justification, the
badge of her essential goodness, whatever she might actually
do. And look what she had done--from my waist almost to
my knees I still felt the afterglow of the most intense sensual
pleasure I had ever known, and everywhere its emotional cor-
relate glowed too.
I had done two turns when I stopped in one of the larger,
emptier expanses of the Common. A good way off, on all sides,
the traffic turned about me like planets. Usually it oppressed
me to reflect that every car contained a nexus of worries, mem-
ories and hopes as vital and complicated as my own. Today I
welcomed and forgave everyone. We would all turn out well.
We were all bound together in our own overlapping but dis-
tinct forms of comedy. Others might also have a lover living
with a death threat. But no one else with an arm in a cast had
a machine for a love rival.

I headed home, north along the High Street, past the
burned-out premises of the Anglo-Argentinian Friendship
Society, past the stinking black heaps of plastic sacks, trebled
in height since I was last this way. A German company had
launched their bipedal dustmen-automata in Glasgow. Public
contempt was aroused because each one wore the perpetual
grin of a contented worker. If Adam could make an origami
boat in seconds, it should not have been much of a stretch to
have a drone chuck sacks into the mechanical maw of a gar-
bage truck. But the filth and dust caused failure in the knee
and elbow joints, according to the Financial Times, and the
cheaper batteries couldn't survive an eight-hour shift. Each
device cost five years' wages of a dustman. Unlike Adam, it
had an exoskeleton and weighed 350 pounds. The automata
were falling behind on the work, and on Sauchiehall Street
the bags were piling up. In Hanover, a robot dustman had
stepped backwards into the path of an autonomous electric
bus. Teething troubles. But in our part of the country, humans
were cheaper, and they remained on strike. General outrage
had given way to apathy. Someone said on the radio that the
stink was no more remarkable than in Calcutta or Dar es
Salaam. We could all adapt.
Peter Gorringe. Once I had the name, it was easy to find
the press reports as I waited with my throbbing wrist in Casu-
alty. They dated back three years and, as I'd guessed, con-
cerned a rape. As victim, Miranda's name was withheld. In
broad outline, the case resembled a thousand others: alcohol
and a dispute over consent. She went one evening to Gor-
ringe's bedsit in the centre of town. They knew each other

from school, which they had left only months before, but they
were not close friends. That night, alone together, they drank
a fair amount and around nine o'clock, after some kissing,
which neither side denied, he forced himself on her, according
to the prosecution. She tried to fight him off.
Both parties agreed that intercourse took place. Gorringe's
defence, provided through legal aid, argued that she had been
a willing partner. Counsel made much of the fact that she had
not called out for help during the alleged assault, nor had she
left Gorringe's place until two hours later, or made any dis-
tressed phone calls to police, parents or friends. The prosecu-
tion case was that she was in a state of shock. She had sat on
the edge of the bed, half dressed, unable to move or speak.
She left around eleven, went straight home, did not wake her
father, lay on her bed crying until she fell asleep. The next
morning she went to the local police station.
It was in Gorringe's story that the particulars of this case
emerged. He told the court that after they made love, they
drank more vodka and lemonade, that the post-coital mood
was celebratory. She asked him if he had any objection to her
texting her new friend Amelia to announce that she and Peter
were an "item." Within a minute there came a reply in the
form of a laughing emoticon making the thumbs-up sign. The
case for the defence should have been simple. But the messages
were not on Miranda's phone. Amelia had been living in a hos-
tel for problem teenagers, and had gone off backpacking and
couldn't be traced. The phone company in Canada would not
release their record of texts without a formal approach from
the police. But the police had targets to meet for solved rape

cases and were keen to see Gorringe go down. They knew, as
the jury did not, that he had previous convictions for shoplift-
ing and affray.
In evidence, Miranda was emphatic that she had no friend
called Amelia and that the story of the text was a fabrication.
Two of Miranda's old school friends gave evidence in court that
they had never heard mention of this Amelia. The prosecu-
tion suggested that it was too convenient, a vanishing rootless
teenager. If she was on a beach in Thailand, and if Miranda
was her friend, where were the customary teenage photos and
messages? Where was Miranda's original message? Where
was that merry emoticon?
Deleted by Miranda, said the defence. If the court would
suspend proceedings and serve an order on the British sub-
sidiary of the phone company to release its copies of the texts,
these disputed versions of a summer evening would be settled.
But the judge, whose manner throughout was impatient, even
irritable, was in no mind to let the matter drag on. Mr. Gor-
ringe's defence had already had many months to mount their
case. A court order should have been sought long ago. Memo-
rably, the judge noted that a young woman who took a bottle
of vodka to a young man's room should have been aware of the
risks. Some press reports portrayed Gorringe as a guilty sort.
He was large, loose-limbed, he lounged in the dock, he didn't
wear a tie. He appeared not to be awed by the judge or his
court and its procedures. The jury was unanimous in favour-
ing Miranda's story over his. Later, in his summing-up, the
judge did not find the accused a credible witness. But certain
sections of the press were sceptical about Miranda's story. The
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

137
judge was criticised for not putting the matter beyond doubt
by calling in her text records.
A week later, before sentencing, there were pleas of miti-
gation. The headmaster of their school spoke up for both
ex-pupils--hardly helpful. Gorringe's mother, who was too
scared to be articulate, tried bravely but wept from the witness
stand. No use at all to her son. He rose for sentencing and was
impassive. Six years. He shook his head, as the accused often
do. If he behaved himself in prison, he would be gone for half
his sentence.
The jury had confronted a stark choice. Miranda raped and
honest, or unmolested and a cruel liar. Naturally, I could bear
neither. I didn't take Gorringe's murderous threats as proof of
his innocence, as the intentions of a wronged man looking for
redress. A guilty man could be furious at his loss of freedom.
If he could threaten to kill, he could surely rape.
Beyond the either-or was a dangerous middle ground
where the half-forgotten student anthropologist in me could
free his imagination of all constraint. Grant the insidious
power of self-persuasion, mix in some hours of carefree teen-
age drinking and blurred recall, then it would have been pos-
sible for Miranda to feel genuinely that she'd been violated,
especially if afterwards there were elements of shame; equally
possible for Peter Gorringe to convince himself he had per-
mission when he desired it so urgently. But in the criminal
courts, the sword of justice fell on innocence or guilt, not both
at once.

as rapist may have calculated that he had nothing to lose. A
wild fiction and he almost got away with it. If he was innocent,
if the texts existed, then the system had let him down. Either
way, it had let itself down. His story should have been checked.
On that, I was with the sceptical press. The blame could lie
with an inexperienced legal aid team, too hard-pressed, too
sloppy. Or with policemen greedy for success. And certainly
with an ill-tempered judge.
On my way back from the Common, 1 slowed as I turned
into my road. Now I knew as much as Adam. I hadn't spoken to
him since the evening before. After a painful, sleepless night,
I had got up early to go to the hospital. As I went through
the kitchen I had passed close by him. He was sitting at the
kitchen table as usual, connected to his power line. His eyes
were open and had that tranquil, faraway look whenever he
retreated into his circuits. I had hesitated there for a whole
minute, wondering what I had got into with my purchase. He
was far more complicated than I'd imagined, and so were my
own feelings about him. We had to confront each other, but I
was exhausted from two broken nights and needed to get to
the hospital.
What I wanted now, returning from my walk, was to
retreat to my bedroom for a dose of painkillers and a nap. But
he was standing facing me as I came in. At the sight of my
arm suspended in its sling, he gave a cry of astonishment or
horror. He came towards me, arms spread.
"Charlie! I am so sorry. So sorry. What a terrible thing I
did. I honestly didn't intend it. Will you please, please accept
my most sincere apologies."

It looked as though he was about to embrace me. With
my free hand, I pushed past--I disliked the too-solid feel
and went to the sink. I turned on the tap and bent
low to drink deeply. When I turned, he was standing close,
no more than three or four feet away. The moment of apol-
ogy had passed. 1 was determined to look relaxed--not so easy
with my arm in a sling. I put my free hand on my hip and
looked into his eyes, into the nursery blue with its little black
seeds. 1 still wondered what it meant, that Adam could see,
and who or what did the seeing. A torrent of zeros and ones
flashed towards various processors that, in turn, directed a cas-
cade of interpretation towards other centres. No mechanistic
explanation could help. It couldn't resolve the essential differ-
ence between us. I had little idea of what passed along my own
optic nerve, or where it went next, or how these pulses became
an encompassing self-evident visual reality, or who was doing
my seeing for me. Only me. Whatever the process was, it had
the trick of seeming beyond explanation, of creating and sus-
taining an illuminated part of the one thing in the world we
knew for sure--our own experience. It was hard to believe
that Adam possessed something like that. Easier to believe
that he saw in the way a camera does, or the way a microphone
is said to listen. There was no one there.
of him-
But as I looked into his eyes, I began to feel unhinged,
uncertain. Despite the clean divide between the living and
the inanimate, it remained the case that he and I were bound
by the same physical laws. Perhaps biology gave me no special
status at all, and it meant little to say that the figure standing

drifting into the oceanic blue and black, moving in two direc-
-towards the uncontrollable future we were
making for ourselves where we might finally dissolve our bio-
logical identities; at the same time, into the ancient past of
an infant universe, where the common inheritance, in dimin-
ishing order, was rocks, gases, compounds, elements, forces,
energy fields--for both of us, the seeding ground of conscious-
ness in whatever form it took.
I came out of this reverie with a start. I confronted an
immediate and unpleasant situation and wasn't inclined
to accept Adam as a brother, or even a very distant cousin,
however much Stardust we shared. I had to stand up to him.
I started talking. I told him how I came by a large sum of
money after my mother's death and the sale of her house. How
I decided to invest it in a grand experiment, to buy an arti-
ficial human, an android, a replicate--I forget which term I
used. In his presence, they all sounded like insults. I told him
exactly how much I paid. Then I described for him the after-
noon when Miranda and I carried him on a stretcher into the
house, unpacked him, charged him up, when I tenderly gave
him my clothes, and discussed the formation of his personal-
ity. As I went along, I wasn't certain of my purpose, or why I
was talking so fast.
It was only when I got there that I knew what I had to
say. My point was this: I had bought him, he was mine, I had
decided to share him with Miranda, and it would be our deci-
sion, and only ours, to decide when to deactivate him. If he
resisted, and especially if he caused injury as he had the night

before, then he would have to be returned to the manufacturer
for readjustment. I finished by saying that this was Miranda's
view, as she expressed it earlier this afternoon, just before we
made love. This last intimate detail, for the lowest of reasons,
I needed him to know.
Throughout, he remained impassive, blinking at irregular
intervals, holding my gaze. When I finished, nothing changed
for half a minute and I began to think I had gone too fast, or
spoken gibberish. Suddenly he came to life (to life!), looked
down at his feet, then turned and walked a few paces away. He
turned again to look at me, drew breath to speak, changed his
mind. A hand went up to stroke his chin. What a performance.
Perfect. I was ready to give him my devoted attention.
His tone was of the sweetest, most reasonable kind.
"We're in love with the same woman. We can talk about it in
a civilised manner, as you just have. Which convinces me that
we've passed the point in our friendship when one of us has the
power to suspend the consciousness of the other."
I said nothing.
He continued. "You and Miranda are my oldest friends. I
love you both. My duty to you is to be clear and frank. I mean
it when I say how sorry I am I broke a bit of you last night.
I promise it will never happen again. But the next time you
reach for my kill switch, I'm more than happy to remove your
arm entirely, at the ball and socket joint."
He said this kindly, as though offering help with some dif-
ficult task.
I said, "That would be messy. And fatal."

"Oh no. There are ways of doing it cleanly and safely.
A practice refined in medieval times. Galen was the first to
describe it. Speed is of the essence."
"Well, don't take my good arm."
He had been speaking through a smile. Now he began to
laugh. So here it was, his first attempt at a joke, and I joined
in. I was in a state of exhaustion and suddenly found it wildly
hilarious.
As I passed him on my way to the bedroom he said, "Seri-
ously. After last night I came to a decision. I've found a way to
disable the kill switch. Easier for all of us."
"Good," I said, not quite taking this in. "Very sensible."
I entered my room and closed the door behind me. I kicked
off my shoes, and lay on the bed on my back, softly laughing to
myself. Then, forgetting about the painkillers, I was asleep in
less than two minutes.
The next morning I turned thirty-three. It rained all day
and I worked for nine hours, content to be indoors. For the first
time in weeks, my profit for the day was in three figures--just.
At seven I stood up from my desk, stretched, yawned, looked
in my drawer for a clean white shirt, then took a bath. I had to
hang my arm over the edge to protect the cast from dissolving,
but otherwise I was in good shape. I lay in the heat and rising
steam, singing snatches of Beatles songs in the tiled echo, the
new old Beatles, and occasionally topping up the hot with my
healed toe now fit to turn a tap. I soaped myself single-handed.
Not easy. Thirty-three seemed as significant as twenty-one and

Miranda was treating me to dinner. We were meeting up in
Soho. The simple prospect of a rendezvous with her raised my
spirits. The view I had along the length of my body was uplift-
ing in the misty light. My penis, capsized above its submerged
reef of hair, winked encouragement with a cocky single eye.
So it should. The muscles of my gut and legs looked nicely
sculpted. Heroic even. I wallowed in self-love, happier than I'd
been in weeks. I'd been trying not to think about Adam all day
and had almost succeeded. He'd been in the kitchen for hours,
he was there now--"thinking." I didn't care. I sang louder.
In my twenties, some of my most cheerful times were spent
getting ready to go out. It was the anticipation rather than
the thing itself. The release from work, the bath, music, clean
clothes, white wine, perhaps a pull on a joint. Then stepping
out into the evening, free and hungry.
The pads of my fingers were well wrinkled by the time
I got out. An adaptation, I'd read, of our sea- and river-loving
ancestors to enable them to catch fish. I didn't believe it, but
I liked the story, the way it lay beyond disproof. We didn't
catch fish with our feet, so toes didn't need to wrinkle like
that. I dressed in a hurry. In the kitchen I passed Adam with-
out a word--he didn't look round--and put up my umbrella
to walk the few hundred yards down a squalid side-street to
where my wreck of a car was parked. This short depressing
stroll often brought me to my usual lament, to the song of my
unhappy lot. But not tonight.
My car dated from the mid-sixties, a British Leyland
Urbala, the first model to do 1,000 miles on a single charge,
it had 380,000 on the clock. Rust was eating it away, espe-

cially around the dents in the bodywork. The wing mirrors
had snapped or been snapped off. There was a long white rip in
the driver's seat and a piece of the steering wheel, from eleven
to three o'clock, was missing. Years ago, a girl had been sick on
the back seat after a rowdy Indian dinner and not even profes-
sional steam-cleaning could erase the scent of vindaloo. The
Urbala had only two doors and it was awkward to get an adult
into the back seat. But there was little to go wrong with these
engines and the car ran smooth and fast. It was an automatic
and easy to drive with one hand.
I took my usual route, singing all the way, to Vauxhall,
then downstream with the river on my left, past Lambeth Pal-
ace and the abandoned St. Thomas's Hospital, where scores or
hundreds of the homeless squatted. The windscreen wiper on
the driver's side worked every ten seconds or so. The wiper
on the passenger side thumped out a beat to my pop tunes. I
crossed the Thames by Waterloo Bridge--in both directions,
best views in town--then slipped down to take the sinuous
curves of the old tram tunnel at speed and burst in triumph
into Holborn--not the shortest route to Soho, but my favour-
ite. I was hitting some high notes on a new Lennon song.
What was right with me? Thirty-three today and in love.
The unaccountable brew of hormone cocktails--endorphins,
dopamine, oxytocin and all the rest. Cause or effect or associ-
ation--we knew next to nothing about our passing moods. It
seemed objectionable that they should have a material base.
On this particular evening, I hadn't touched grass or even had
a sip of wine--there was nothing in the house. Yesterday I had
been almost thirty-three and in love and I hadn't felt like this.

PS104 up on the morning would never have such an effect. I
should have been sobered by yesterday's exchange with Adam
about his kill switch, by all the matters I hadn't raised with
Miranda, by my poor wrist. But a mood could be a roll of the
dice. Chemical roulette. Free will demolished, and here I was,
feeling free.
I parked in Soho Square. I knew of a three-metre stretch
where the yellow lines had been tarred over in error and the
space was legal. Most cars wouldn't fit. Our restaurant, a one-
room shoebox with fierce strip lighting, was in Greek Street,
just a few doors along from the famous L'Escargot. There were
only seven tables. In a corner was an open kitchen, a tiny space
defined by a brushed-steel counter, where two chefs in white
gear cooked in sweaty proximity. There was a plongeur, and
one waiter to serve and clear tables. Unless you knew the chef,
or knew someone who did, you couldn't book. Miranda had a
friend at one further remove. On a quiet night it was enough.
She was there before me, already seated, facing the door as
I came in. In front of her was an untouched glass of sparkling
water. Beside it, a small parcel done up with green ribbon. By
the table, in an ice bucket on a stand, was a bottle of cham-
pagne, its neck bound in a white napkin. The waiter, who
had just drawn the cork, was walking away. Miranda looked
especially elegant, even though she'd been at seminars all day
and had left the house wearing jeans and a t-shirt. She would
have taken with her a bag of clothes and make-up. She wore a
black pencil skirt and a tight black jacket with boxy shoulders
and silver thread woven through the fabric. I'd never seen her
before with lipstick and mascara. She had made her mouth

smaller, in a dark red bow, and dusted away the faint freckles
on the bridge of her nose. My birthday! At the same time, as I
entered the bright white light and closed the restaurant's glass
door behind me, I felt a sudden elated detachment. I didn't, I
couldn't, love her less. But I no longer had to feel anxious or
desperate about her. I remembered my truisms from the day
before. Here she was, and whatever she was, I would find out
and celebrate her, regardless. I could love her, so I thought, and
remain immune, unharmed.
All this in a flash as I squeezed between two crowded
tables to get to her. She raised her right hand and in mock
formal fashion I bowed and kissed it. As I sat down she gazed
at my sling with evident pity.
"Poor darling."
The waiter--he looked sixteen and serious--came with
glasses, and filled them while holding his hand behind his
back. A professional.
As we raised and clinked them across the table, I said, "To
Adam not breaking more of my bones."
"That's rather limiting."
We laughed, and it seemed as though laughter at the
other tables followed and rose with ours. What a wild place
we were in. She didn't know how much, how little, I knew. I
didn't know what to believe about her, whether she was the
victim or perpetrator of a crime. It didn't matter. We were in
love and I remained convinced that even if I came to know
the worst, it would make no difference. Love would see us
through. It should have been easier, therefore, to broach any

of the issues that my cowardice inclined me to suppress. And
I was on the edge of doing just that, of saying more about my
broken scaphoid, when she took my good hand in hers across
the white linen.
"Yesterday was glorious."
I was giddy. It was as if she had proposed that we make
love in public, now, across the table.
"We could go home right now."
She did a comic little double-take. "You haven't opened
your present."
She pushed it across with a forefinger. While I unwrapped
it, our boy waiter refilled the glasses. I found a small plain
cardboard box. Inside was a z-shaped piece of strip metal with
padding on the parallel surfaces. A wrist exerciser.
"For when your plaster comes off."
I stood and went around the table to kiss her. Someone
nearby said, "Oi-oi!" Another person made the sound of a
barking dog. I wasn't bothered. Back in my seat I said, "Adam
says he's disabled his kill switch."
She leaned forward, suddenly serious. "You've got to get
him back to the shop."
"But he loves you. He told me."
"You're making fun of me."
I said, "If he needs reprogramming, you're the one he'll
listen to."
Her tone was plaintive. "How can he talk about love? This
is madness."
Our waiter was hovering and heard everything we said

next, even though I murmured quickly. "You helped choose
the kind of guy he is--the sort who falls in love with the first
woman he sleeps with."
"Oh, Charlie!"
The boy said, "Have you decided yet, or shall I come back?"
"Stick around."
We passed a couple of minutes choosing and changing our
minds. I ordered at random a twelve-year-old Haut-Medoc.
It occurred to me that I was the one paying for my birthday
treat. I cancelled the order and asked for a twenty-year-old
bottle of the same.
The waiter left and we paused to consider where we were.
Miranda said, "Are you seeing someone else?"
The question astonished me and for a moment I was stuck
for the most reassuring and convincing reply. At the same
time, I noticed that the chef, who was also the owner, had come
from behind the counter and was making his way between the
tables to the door. The waiter was following him. I glanced
over my shoulder and saw through the glass two figures out
on the pavement. One of them was folding away an umbrella.
I must have looked evasive to Miranda. She added, "Just
be honest with me. I don't mind."
She clearly did mind and I gave her my full attention.
"Absolutely not. You're all I care about."
"When I'm out all day at seminars?"
"I work and I think about you."
I felt a draught of cool air on my neck. Miranda's gaze
shifted from me to the door and I felt I could turn again and
look. The chef was helping two elderly men out of their long

raincoats, which he dumped into the arms of the waiter. The
men were led to their table--set apart and the only one with
a lit candle. The taller man had swept-back silvery hair and
wore a brown silk scarf loosely knotted around his neck and
some kind of artist's cotton jacket that drooped from his shoul-
ders. A chair was held out for him and before sitting he looked
around the room and nodded to himself. No one else in the
restaurant seemed interested. The man's style of bohemian
grandeur was not so unusual in Soho. But I was excited.
I turned back to Miranda, still aware of her surprising
query, and placed my hand on hers.
"Do you know who he is?"
"No idea."
"Alan Turing."
"Your hero."
"And Thomas Reah, the physicist. Invented loop quantum
gravity more or less single-handed."
"Go and say hello."
"That would not be cool."
So we returned to the question of the someone else I was
not seeing, and once she appeared satisfied, we went back to
Adam and discussed how we might overcome his resistance to
the kill switch. She suggested hiding the charging cables until
he was too weak to resist us. I reminded her of his instant ori-
gami sailboat. He would improvise a power cable in minutes.
My concentration was poor during this exchange. I kept look-
ing at her, hallucinating a glow around her head and shoulders
and thinking about the time when we would be alone, travel-
ling the smooth and rising curve to ecstasy. Even as I was hob-

bled by a state of continuous sexual arousal, it excited me to be
in the same room as a great man. From pre-war meditations on
the idea of a universal computing machine, to Bletchley in the
early years of the war, to morphogenesis, to his glorious patri-
cian present. The greatest living Englishman, noble and free
in his love for another man. In his seniority, dressed with the
flamboyance of a rock star, a genius painter, a knighted actor.
I could see him only if I turned rudely away from Miranda.
I resisted. I distracted myself with the usual list, the buried
suspicions, all we had not touched on--the Salisbury court
case and the death threat being the most rank. Where was my
courage when I lacked the clarity to raise these subjects, when
they tormented me while they remained unspoken?
"You're not even listening."
"I am, I am. You said Adam's got a screw loose."
"I didn't. Idiot. But happy birthday."
We raised our glasses again. The Medoc was bottled when
Miranda was two years old and my father was moving out of
swing into bebop.
The meal was a success, but the bill was a long time com-
ing. While we waited we decided on a parting cognac. The
drinks the waiter brought were double measures, on the house.
Miranda returned to the business of her father's illness. The
new diagnosis was lymphoma, of a slow-acting kind. He was
likely to die with it rather than of it. He had much else to die
of. But there was a pill he now took that made him cheerful
and assertive--and even more of a handful. Impossible proj-
ects filled his thoughts. He wanted to sell the Salisbury house
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

and buy an apartment in New York, in the East Village, not
the current one, she suspected, but the Village of his youth.
On a rush of self-belief, he had signed a contract to deliver a
coffee-table book on the folklore of British birds--a vast proj-
ect that he could never hope to complete, even with a full-time
researcher. On a strange whim, given his views, he had joined
a fringe political group dedicated to taking Britain out of the
European Union. He was up for election as treasurer at his
London club, the Athenaeum. Every day he phoned his daugh-
ter with new schemes. Everything I heard made me gloomier
about our proposed visit, but I said nothing.
At last we were done and we shrugged on our coats.
Miranda preceded me towards the door. Our path between the
tables would take us close to Turing's. As we approached, I
saw that apart from a bowl of nuts, hardly touched, the distin-
guished diners had eaten nothing. They were here to talk and
drink. In an ice bucket was a half-bottle of Dutch genever, and
on the table were ice cubes in a silver dish and two cut-glass
tumblers. I was impressed. Would I be so game at seventy?
Turing was facing me directly. The years had lengthened his
face, marking out the cheekbones, giving him a keen ferocious
look. Many years later I thought I saw the ghost of Alan Turing
in the figure of the painter Lucian Freud. I crossed his path
late one night as he came out of the Wolseley in Piccadilly.
Same lean fitness in early old age that seemed derived less
from healthy living than from a hunger to keep on creating.
The decision was taken for me by the cognac. I approached
as millions before me had approached a famous presence in a

public place, with outward humility masking the entitlement
that genuine admiration confers. Turing glanced up at me,
then looked away. Dealing with admirers was Reah's business.
I wasn't drunk enough to be unembarrassed and I stumbled
over the formulaic opener.
"Really sorry to intrude. I just wanted to express my pro-
found gratitude to you both for your work."
"That's very kind," Reah said. "What's your name?"
"Charlie Friend."
"Very nice to have met you, Charlie."
The tense was clear. I came to my point. "I read that you
have one of these Adams or Eves. I've got one too. I wondered
if you've experienced any sort of problem with . . ."
I trailed away because I had seen Reah look at Turing,
who had firmly shaken his head.
I took out my card and put it on their table. Neither man
looked at it. I retreated, muttering my foolish apologies.
Miranda was right beside me. She took my hand and as we
stepped out into Greek Street she gave a sympathetic squeeze.
"In her loving look,
a whole universe contained.
Love the universe!"
This was the first of his poems that Adam recited to me.
He had come into my bedroom without knocking just after
eleven one morning, while I was working at my screen, hoping

to take advantage of volatility in the currency markets. There
was a square of sunlight on the carpet and he made a point of
standing in it. I noticed he was wearing one of my turtleneck
sweaters. He must have taken it from my drawer. He told me
he had a poem he urgently needed to recite. I swivelled in my
chair and waited.
When he finished I said unkindly, "Short at least."
He winced. "A haiku."
"Ah. Nineteen syllables."
"Seventeen. Five then seven then five again. Here's
another." He paused, looked towards the ceiling.
"Kiss the space where she
trod from here to the window.
She made prints in time."
I said, "Spacetime?"
"Yes!"
"OK," I said. "One more. I've got to get on."
"I've got hundreds. But look . . ."
He left his illuminated spot and came to my desk and put
his hand over the mouse. "These two rows of figures, don't you
see? Intersecting Fibonacci curves. A high probability that if
you buy here and wait. . . now sell. Look. You made PS31."
"Do that again."
"Best to wait."
"Then do me one more haiku and leave."
He returned to his square of light.

"You and the moment
Came when I touched your--"
"I don't want to hear that."
"I shouldn't show it to her?"
I sighed and he moved away. As he reached the door I
added, "Clean up the kitchen and bathroom, would you,
please? Difficult to do with one hand."
He nodded and went away. A kind of peace or stability
had settled over our household, despite the matter of Gor-
ringe's release. I was more relaxed. Adam was spending no
time alone with Miranda, while I was with her every night. I
was confident he would keep his promise. He had told me sev-
eral times that he was in love, and chaste love was fine by me.
He wrote poems in his thoughts and stored them there. He
wanted to talk to me about Miranda but I usually cut him off.
I didn't dare attempt to power him down and I had no particu-
lar need. The plan to get him back to the salesroom was set
aside. Love appeared to have softened him. For reasons I didn't
understand, he was eager for my approval. Guilt, perhaps. He
had fallen back into a routine of vague obedience. I remained
cautious because of my wrist and I was watchful--but noth-
ing of that showed. I reminded myself that he was still my
experiment, my adventure. It was not supposed to run smooth
at every turn.
With Adam's love came intellectual exuberance. He
insisted on telling me his latest thoughts, his theories, his
aphorisms, his latest reading. He was putting himself through
a course on quantum mechanics. All night, while he charged
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

up, he contemplated the mathematics and the basic texts. He
read Schrodinger's Dublin lectures, What Is Life?, from which
he concluded that he was alive. He read the transcript of the
celebrated 1927 Solvay conference, when the luminaries of
physics met to discuss photons and electrons.
"It was said that at these early Solvay meetings there took
place the most profound exchanges about nature in the history
of ideas."
I was at breakfast. I told him I'd once read that the elderly
Einstein, while at Princeton in his final years, started each
day with eggs fried in butter and that in Adam's honour, I was
frying two now for myself.
Adam said, "People said he never grasped what he himself
had started. Solvay was a battlefield for him. Outnumbered,
poor fellow. By extraordinary young men. But that was unfair.
The young Turks weren't concerned with what nature is, only
with what one could say about it. Whereas Einstein thought
there was no science without belief in an external world inde-
pendent of the observer. He didn't think quantum mechanics
was wrong so much as incomplete."
This after one night's study. I remembered my hopeless
brief entanglement with physics at college, before I found
safety in anthropology. 1 suppose I was a little jealous, espe-
cially when I learned that Adam had got his mind round
Dirac's equation. 1 cited Richard Feynman's remark that any-
one who claims to understand quantum theory doesn't under-
stand quantum theory.
Adam shook his head. "A bogus paradox, if it's even a par-
adox at all. Tens of thousands understand it, millions make

use of it. It's a matter of time, Charlie. General relativity was
once at the outer edge of difficulty. Now it's routine for first-
year undergraduates. The same was true of the calculus. Now
fourteen-year-olds can do it. One day quantum mechanics will
pass into common sense."
By this time I was eating my eggs. Adam had made the
coffee. It was far too strong. I said, "OK. What about that Sol-
vay question? Is quantum mechanics a description of nature or
just an effective way of predicting things?"
"I would have been on Einstein's side. I don't understand
the doubt about it," he said. "Quantum mechanics makes pre-
dictions to such a fabulous degree of accuracy, it must be getting
something right about nature. To creatures of our immense
size, the material world looks blurred and feels hard. But now
we know how strange and wonderful it is. So it shouldn't sur-
prise us that consciousness, your sort and mine, could arise
from an arrangement of matter--it's clearly odd to just the
right degree. And we don't have anything else to explain
how matter can think and feel." Then he added, "Except for
beams of love from the eyes of God. But then, beams can be
investigated."
Another morning, after he had told me how he had been
thinking all night of Miranda, he said, "I've also been think-
ing about vision and death."
"Go on."
"We don't see everywhere. We can't see behind our heads.
We can't even see our chins. Let's say our field of vision is
almost 180 degrees, counting in peripheral awareness. The

odd thing is, there's no boundary, no edge. There isn't vision
and then blackness, like you get when you look through bin-
oculars. There isn't something, then nothing. What we have is
the field of vision, and then beyond it less than nothing."
"So?"
"So this is what death is like. Less than nothing. Less than
blackness. The edge of vision is a good representation of the
edge of consciousness. Life, then death. It's a foretaste, Charlie,
and it's there all day."
"Nothing to be afraid of then," I said.
He raised both hands as if to grip and shake a trophy.
"Exactly right! Less than nothing to be afraid of!"
Was he covering for an anxiety about death? His term was
fixed for approximately twenty years. When I asked, he said,
"That's the difference between us, Charlie. My body parts
will be improved or replaced. But my mind, my memories,
experiences, identity and so on will be uploaded and retained.
They'll be of use."
Poetry was another instance of his exuberance in love. He
had written 2,000 haikus and had recited about a dozen, of the
same quality, each one devoted to Miranda. I'd been interested
at first in learning what Adam could create. But I soon lost
interest in the form itself. Too cute, too devoted to not making
much sense, too undemanding of their author as they played
on empty mysteries of the sound-of-one-hand-clapping sort.
Two thousand! The figure made my point--an algorithm was
churning them out. I said all this as we walked the backstreets
of Stockwell--our daily exercise to extend Adam's social skills.

We'd been into shops, pubs and had even taken a trip on the
Tube to Green Park and sat on the grass among the lunchtime
crowds.
Perhaps I was too harsh. Haikus, I told him, could be sti-
fling in their stillness. But I was also encouraging. Time to
move on to another form. He had access to all the world's lit-
erature. Why not attempt a poem with verses of four lines,
rhyming or not? Or even a short story and eventually a novel?
Early that evening he gave me his response. "If you don't
mind, I'm ready to discuss your suggestions."
I was not long out of the shower, freshly dressed and on my
way upstairs, therefore a little impatient. On the table, wait-
ing to come with me, was a bottle of Pomerol. There was a
conversation I needed to have with Miranda. Gorringe was
due to be released in seven weeks. We still hadn't decided what
to do. There was an assumption that Adam could act as her
bodyguard and I was worried--I was legally responsible for
anything he might do. She had been back to the local police
station. The detective who had visited Gorringe in prison had
moved on. The desk sergeant had taken a note and advised her
to phone emergency in the event of trouble. She had suggested
that it might be difficult if she was being bludgeoned at the
time. The sergeant did not take this to be facetious. He advised
her to make the call before that eventuality.
"When I see him coming up the garden path with an axe?"
"Yes. And don't open the door."
She had seen a solicitor about going before a judge to get
an exclusion order. Success was not certain and it wasn't clear
what it would achieve. She had asked her father not to divulge

her address to anyone. But Maxfield had worries of his own
and she thought he'd forget. We were left with the hope that
the threat wasn't serious and that Adam would be a deterrent.
When I asked her how dangerous Gorringe really was, she
said, "He's a creep."
"A dangerous creep?"
"A disgusting creep."
I wasn't in the right mood for another conversation with
Adam about poetry.
"My opinion," he said, "is that the haiku is the literary
form of the future. I want to refine and extend the form.
Everything I've done so far is a kind of limbering up. My juve-
nilia. When I've studied the masters and understood more,
especially when I've grasped the power of the kireji, the cut-
ting word that separates the two juxtaposed parts, my real
work can begin."
From upstairs I heard the phone ring and Miranda's foot-
steps across my ceiling.
Adam said, "As a thinking man with an interest in anthro-
pology and politics, you won't be much interested in optimism.
But beyond the currents of disheartening facts about human
nature and societies and daily bad news, there can be might-
ier stirrings, positive developments that are lost to view. The
world is so connected now, however crudely, and change is so
widely distributed that progress is hard to perceive. I don't
like to boast, but one of those changes is right in front of you.
The implications of intelligent machines are so immense that

motion. One anxiety is that it will be a shock and an insult to

live with entities that are cleverer than you are. But already
almost everyone knows someone cleverer than themselves. On
top of which, you underestimate yourselves."
I could make out Miranda's voice on the phone. She was
agitated. She was walking up and down her sitting room as
she spoke.
Adam appeared not to hear her but I knew he had. "You
won't allow yourselves to be left behind. As a species, you're far
too competitive. Even now there are paralysed patients with
electrodes implanted in the motor strip of their brains who
merely think of the action and can raise an arm or bend a fin-
ger. This is a humble beginning and there are many problems
to solve. They'll certainly be solved, and when they are, and a
brain--machine interface is efficient and cheap, you'll become
a partner with your machines in the open-ended expansion of
intelligence, and of consciousness generally. Colossal intelli-
gence, instant access to deep moral acumen and to everything
known, but more importantly, access to each other."
Miranda's pacing upstairs had ceased.
"It could be the end of mental privacy. You'll probably
come to value it less in the face of the enormous gains. You
might be wondering what relevance any of this has to the
haiku. It's this. Ever since I've been here, I've been surveying
the literature of scores of countries. Magnificent traditions,

"Apart from lyrical poetry celebrating love or landscape,
almost everything I read in literature--"
Her key was in my door and then she was before us. Her
face had a greasy shine. She was doing her best to keep a level
voice. "That was my father on the phone. They let Gorringe
out early. Three weeks ago. He's been to Salisbury, to the
house, talked his way past the housekeeper and got my address
out of my father. He could be on his way here now."
She lowered herself into the nearest kitchen chair. I too
sat down.
Adam took in Miranda's news and nodded. But he pressed
on into our silence. "Nearly everything I've read in the world's
literature describes varieties of human failure--of under-
standing, of reason, of wisdom, of proper sympathies. Failures
of cognition, honesty, kindness, self-awareness; superb depic-
tions of murder, cruelty, greed, stupidity, self-delusion, above
all, profound misunderstanding of others. Of course, goodness
is on show too, and heroism, grace, wisdom, truth. Out of this
rich tangle have come literary traditions, flourishing, like the
wild flowers in Darwin's famous hedgerow. Novels ripe with
tension, concealment and violence as well as moments of love
and perfect formal resolution. But when the marriage of men
and women to machines is complete, this literature will be
redundant because we'll understand each other too well. We'll
inhabit a community of minds to which we have immediate
access. Connectivity will be such that individual nodes of the
subjective will merge into an ocean of thought, of which our
Internet is the crude precursor. As we come to inhabit each

other's minds, we'll be incapable of deceit. Our narratives
will no longer record endless misunderstanding. Our litera-
tures will lose their unwholesome nourishment. The lapidary
haiku, the still, clear perception and celebration of things as
they are, will be the only necessary form. I'm sure we'll trea-
sure the literature of the past, even as it horrifies us. We'll look
back and marvel at how well the people of long ago depicted
their own shortcomings, how they wove brilliant, even opti-
mistic fables out of their conflicts and monstrous inadequacies
and mutual incomprehension."

A
dam's Utopia masked a nightmare, as Utopias generally
do, but it was a mere abstraction. Miranda's nightmare
was real and instantly became mine. We sat beside
each other at the table, flustered and dumb, a rare combina-
tion. It was left to Adam to be clear-headed and set out the
reassuring facts. Nothing Maxfield had said on the phone
indicated that Gorringe was on his way here tonight. If he'd
been out three weeks, murder was clearly not his priority. He
could arrive tomorrow, or next month, or never. If he hoped
to succeed without witnesses, he would have to kill all three
of us. He would be an obvious suspect in any crime against
Miranda. Even if he came this evening, he would find Miran-
da's flat in darkness. He knew nothing about her connection
with me. It was likely that the threat itself was all the punish-
ment he intended. Finally, we had a strongman on our side.
If necessary, he could keep Gorringe talking while one of us
called the police.
Time to open the wine!
Adam set three glasses on the table. Miranda preferred my

father's Edwardian teak-handled corkscrew to my fancy gad-
get with a lever. The effort seemed to settle her. The first glass
settled me. To keep us company, Adam sipped at a third of a
glass of warm water. Our fears were not quite dispelled but
now, in this party atmosphere, we returned to Adam's little
thesis. We even raised a toast to "the future," though his ver-
sion of it, private mental space drowned by new technology in
an ocean of collective thought, repelled us both. Fortunately,
it was as feasible as the project of implanting the brains of
billions.
I said to Adam, "I'd like to think that there will always be
someone, somewhere, not writing haikus."
We raised our glasses to that too. No one was in the mood
for an argument. The only other possible topic was Gorringe
and everything related to him. That conversation was just
starting when I excused myself and went to the bathroom. As
I was washing my hands, I found myself thinking about Mark
and my fleeting sense of privilege in the playground when he
put his hand in mine. I remembered his look of resilient intel-
ligence. I thought of him not as a child, but as a person in
the context of his entire life. His future was in the hands of
bureaucrats, however kindly, and the choices they made for
him. He could easily sink. Miranda had so far been unable to
get news of him. Finding Jasmin, or any social worker willing
to talk to her, was impossible. There were, she was told at last
by someone in the right department, issues of confidentiality.
Despite that, she learned that the father had vanished and the
mother had drink and drug problems.
As I was returning to the kitchen I had a moment of nostal-
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

gia for my life as it was before Gorringe, Adam, even Miranda.
As an existence, it had been insufficient but relatively simple.
Simpler still if I'd left my mother's money in the bank.
Here was my lover at the table, beautiful and outwardly com-
posed. As I sat down, it wasn't irritation I felt towards her,
though that wasn't far off. More like detachment. I saw what
must have been obvious to everyone--her secretiveness; also,
her inability to ask for help, her trick of getting it anyway,
and of never being held to account. I sat down, drank a little
wine, listened to the conversation--and made a decision. Set-
ting aside Adam's reassurances, I believed she had brought a
murderer into my life. I was expected to help, and I would. But
she had told me nothing. Now I was calling in a debt.
We were looking right at each other. I couldn't keep the
terseness out of my voice. "Did he rape you or not?"
After a pause, during which she continued to hold my
gaze, she shook her head slowly from side to side and then she
said softly, "No."
I waited. She waited. Adam went to speak. I silenced
him with a slight shake of the head. When it was clear that
Miranda was not going to say more---the very reticence that
was oppressing me--I said, "You lied to the court."
"Yes."
"You sent an innocent man to prison."
She sighed.
Again, I waited. My patience was running out, but I didn't
raise my voice. "Miranda. This is stupid. What happened?"
She was looking down at her hands. To my relief, she said,
as though to herself, "It'll take a while."

"Fine."
She began without preamble. Suddenly she seemed eager
to tell her story.
"When I was nine years old a new girl came to our school.
She was brought into the classroom and introduced as Mariam.
She was slender and dark, with beautiful eyes and the blackest
hair you'd ever seen, tied with a white ribbon. Salisbury was
a very white town back then so we were all fascinated by this
girl from Pakistan. T could see that standing there, in front of
the class, being stared at by everyone, was hard for her. It was
as if she was in pain. When our teacher asked who wanted to
be Mariam's special friend and show her around and help her,
I was the first to put up my hand. The boy sitting with me was
moved to another desk and she took his place. We sat together
in class for years to come, in that school and the next. At some
point during our first day, she put her hand in mine. Lots of us
girls were always doing that, but this was different. Her hand
was so delicate and smooth and she was so quiet, so tentative.
I was pretty shy myself, so I was drawn to her quietness and
intimacy. She was far more timid than me, at least at first,
and I think she made me feel for the first time confident and
knowing. I fell in love with her.
"It was a love affair, a crush, very intense. I introduced her
to my friends. I don't remember any racism. The boys ignored
her, the girls were kind to her. They liked to finger her brightly
coloured dresses. She was so unusual, exotic even, and I used
to worry that someone would steal her from me. But she was
a very loyal friend. We kept hold of each other's hand. Within
a month, she took me home to meet her family. Knowing that

I'd lost my mother when I was little, Mariam's mother, Sana,
took me in. She was kind but rather bossy in an affectionate
way. One afternoon she brushed out my hair and tied in one of
Mariam's ribbons. No one had ever done that for me before. I
was overwhelmed and I cried."
The memory had caused her throat to constrict and her
voice to become lighter. She paused and swallowed hard before
starting again.
"I ate curries for the first time and developed a taste
for her home-made puddings, brightly coloured, extremely
sweet laddu, anarsa and soan papdi. There was a little sister,
Surayya, whom Mariam adored, and two older brothers, Far-
han and Hamid. Her father, Yasir, worked for the local author-
ity as a water engineer. He was very nice to me too. It was a
crowded, noisy household, very friendly, argumentative, the
complete opposite of my own. They were religious, Muslim of
course, but at that age 1 was hardly aware of it. Later I took
it for granted, and by then I was a part of the family. When
they went to the mosque, it never crossed my mind to go with
them, or even ask about it. I'd grown up without religion and
I had no interest in it. Mariam was transformed as soon as she
was through her front door. She became playful and far more
talkative. She was her father's favourite. She liked to sit on his
knee when he came in from work. I was a tiny bit jealous.
"I brought her back to my place, which you'll see soon.
Just outside the cathedral close, tall, thin, early Victorian,
untidy, dark, piles of books. My father was always loving but
he spent most of his time in his study and didn't like to be
disturbed. A local lady came in to cook my tea. So we were on

our own, and we liked that. We made a den in an attic room,
we had adventures in our overgrown garden. We watched TV
together. A couple of years later, we clung to each other in
the first bewildering days of secondary school. We did our
homework together. She was far better at maths and good at
explaining problems. I helped her with her written English.
She was hopeless at spelling. As time passed and we became
more self-conscious, we spent hours talking about our fami-
lies. We had our first periods within a few weeks of each other.
Her mother was really sensible and helpful with that. We also
talked about boys, although we didn't go near them. Because
of her brothers, she was less bothered, more sceptical about
boys than I was.
"The years passed, our friendship continued and became
just a fact of life. Our last summer at school came around. We
sat our public exams and thought about university. She wanted
to do science, I was interested in history. We were worried that
we'd end up in different places."
Miranda stopped. She took a long slow breath. As she
resumed, she reached for my hand.
"One Saturday afternoon 1 got a call from her. She was in
a very bad state. At first I couldn't make out what she was say-
ing. She wanted to meet me in a local park. When I got to her,
she couldn't speak. We walked around the park, arm in arm,
and all I could do was wait. At last she told me what had hap-
pened the day before. Her route home from school took her by
some playing fields. It was dusk and she was hurrying because
her parents didn't like her out alone after dark. She became
aware of a figure following her. It seemed to be getting closer

each time she turned to look. She thought of breaking into
a run--she was fast--then decided she was being silly. And
she had a satchel full of books. The person following her was
getting closer. She turned to confront him and was relieved
to see it was someone she vaguely knew--Peter Gorringe. He
wasn't exactly popular, but he was known at school as the only
boy who had his own place. His parents were abroad and had
rented a small bedsit for him for a few months rather than
trust him to look after the house. Before she could speak to him
he ran at her, took hold of her wrist and dragged her behind a
brick shed where they keep the mowers. She screamed but no
one came. He was large, she was very slight. He wrestled her
to the ground and that was where he raped her.
"Mariam and I stood in the park, in the middle of this
big lawn surrounded by flower beds, and hugged and cried
together. Even then, as I was trying to take in this horrific
news, I thought that one day everything would be all right.
She would get through this. Everyone loved and respected her,
everyone would be outraged. Her attacker would go to prison.
I would go to whatever university she chose and stay close to
her.
"When she recovered enough, she showed me the marks
on her legs and thighs, and on each wrist, a row of four little
bruises from his grip when he'd held her down. She told me
how she got home that night, told her father she had a heavy
cold and went straight to bed. It was lucky, the way she saw it,
that her mother was out that evening. She would have known
immediately that something was wrong. That was when
I began to understand that she hadn't told her parents. We

started walking round the park again. I told her she must tell
them. She needed all the help and support she could get. If she
hadn't been to the police yet, I would come with her. Now!
"I'd never seen Mariam so fierce. She seized my hands and
told me that I understood nothing. Her parents were never to
know, nor were the police. I said we should go together and tell
her doctor. When she heard that, she shouted at me. The doctor
would go straight to her mother. He was a family friend. Her
uncles would hear about it. Her brothers would do something
stupid and get themselves in serious trouble. Her family would
be humiliated. Her father would be destroyed if he learned
what had happened. If I was her friend I had to help her in
the way she needed to be helped. She wanted me to promise
to keep her secret. I resisted but she came back at me. She was
furious. She kept telling me that I understood nothing. The
police, the doctor, the school, her family, my father--no one
was to know. I was not to confront Gorringe. If I did, it would
all come out.
"And so, in the end, I did what I knew to be wrong. Since
we didn't have one with me, I swore on 'the idea' of the Bible to
keep Mariam's secret, and on the Koran too, and on our friend-
ship and on my father's life. I did as she asked, even though
I was convinced that her family would have gathered round
her and supported her. And I still believe it. More than that. I
know it for a fact. They loved her and would never have cast
her out or enacted whatever mad idea she had of family hon-
our. They would have put their arms round her and protected
her. Her ideas were all wrong. And I was worse, I was crimi-

nally stupid, going along with this and entering into her secret
pact.
"For the next two weeks we saw each other every day. We
talked of nothing else. For a part of that time I tried to change
her mind. Not a chance. She seemed calmer, even more deter-
mined, and I began to think that perhaps she was right. It was
certainly convenient to think so. Keep silent, avoid a family
trauma, avoid giving evidence to the police, avoid a terrifying
court case. Stay calm and think about the future. We were on
the edge of becoming adults. Our lives were about to change.
This was a catastrophe but she would survive it with my help.
Whenever I saw Gorringe at school I stayed clear of him. That
was getting easier as the term ran down and we school-leavers
began to disperse forever.
"At the beginning of the holidays my father took me
to France to stay with friends who had a farmhouse in the
Dordogne. Before I left, Mariam begged me not to phone
her home. I think she was afraid that if by chance I started
speaking to her mother, I would forget my promise and tell
her everything. By then, lots of people had mobile phones, but
they hadn't quite reached us. So we wrote letters and postcards
every day. I remember being disappointed by hers. They were
not exactly distant so much as dull. There was only one subject
and she couldn't write about it. So she wrote about the weather
and TV programmes and said nothing about her state of mind.
"I was away two weeks and during the last five days noth-
ing came from her. As soon as we were home I went round
to her house. As I approached I saw that the front door was

open. Her older brother Hamid was standing by it. A couple of
neighbours went in, someone came out. I was filled with dread
as I went up to him. He looked ill, very thin, and for a moment
he seemed not to recognise me. Then he told me. She had slit
her wrists in the bath. The funeral had already happened two
days before. I took a couple of steps back from him. I was too
numb for grief, but not too numb for guilt. Mariam was dead
because I'd kept her secret and denied her the help she needed.
I wanted to run away but Hamid made me go into the house
and speak to his mother.
"In my memory I moved through a crowd to get to the
kitchen. But the house was small. There must have been no
more than a dozen visitors. Sana was sitting on a wooden
chair with her back to the wall. There were people around
her but no one was talking, and her face--I'll never escape
that face. Stricken, frozen in pain. As soon as she saw me, she
stretched out her arms towards me and I stooped over her
and we embraced. Her entire body was hot and clammy and
trembling. I wasn't crying. Not yet. Then, while her arms were
around my neck, she asked me in a whisper, she actually asked
me to be honest with her. Was there something she should
know about Mariam, was there something, anything I could
tell her that would make sense of this? I couldn't speak but I
lied with a shake of my head. I was truly scared. I couldn't
even begin to grasp the enormity of my crime. Now I was add-
ing to it by condemning my lovely surrogate mother to a life-
time of anguish and ignorance. I'd killed her daughter with
my silence, now I was crushing her with it.
"Would it have made her burden any easier to know that

her daughter was raped? I could hear the family crying out,
If only we had known! Then they would have turned on me.
Rightly. There was and is no way round it, 1 bear responsibil-
ity for Mariam's death. Seventeen years and nine months old.
I left Sana where she sat and hurried out of the house, avoid-
ing the rest of the family. I couldn't face them. Especially her
father. And Mariam's darling, the little girl, Surayya I was so
close to. I walked away from the house and I've never been
back. Sana wrote to me a few days later, when Mariam's bril-
liant exam results came through. I didn't reply. To be involved
with the family in any way would've been to add to my deceit.
How could I be with them and visit the grave, as she was sug-
gesting, when my presence would be a constant lie?
"So I grieved alone for my friend. There was no one I
dared speak to about her. You're the first person, Charlie, I've
told this story to. I grieved and fell into a long depression. 1
delayed my university course. My father sent me to the doctor,
who prescribed antidepressants, and I was glad of the cover
and pretended to take them. I think I could have gone under
completely that year if it hadn't been for my one ambition in
life--justice. By which I mean revenge.
"Gorringe was still living in his bedsit on the edge of Salis-
bury and that was fortunate, 1 thought, as I made my plans.
I'm sure you've guessed what they were. He was working in
a cafe, saving up to go travelling. When at last I felt strong
enough, I went in there with a book. I studied him and fed my
hatred. And I was friendly towards him when he spoke to me.
I let a week go by before I went back. We spoke again--about
nothing much. I could see he was interested and I waited for

him to ask me round to his place. First time, I told him I was
busy. By the next I could see he was getting really keen and
I agreed to call on him. I could hardly sleep for thinking and
planning. 1 would never have imagined that hatred could
bring such elation. I didn't care what happened to me along
the way. I was reckless, ready to pay any price. Getting him
sent down for rape was my sole reason for keeping going. Ten
years, twelve, his entire lifetime wouldn't have been enough.
"I took a half-bottle of vodka with me. It was all I could
afford. I'd had two boyfriends by that summer and I knew what
to do. That night, I got Gorringe drunk and seduced him. You
know the rest. Whenever revulsion started to get the better of
me, I thought of him wrestling Mariam to the ground, ignor-
ing her screams and pleas. I thought of my friend lowering
herself into the bath, feeling completely alone, dishonoured
and without hope and any wish to live.
"My plan had been to leave straight after Gorringe was
done with me and go to the police. But I was so disgusted and
numbed by the experience I couldn't move. And when I man-
aged to get myself off the bed and dressed, I worried that I had
drunk too much and wouldn't be convincing in front of the
desk sergeant. But it worked out well enough in the morning.
I made a point of not changing my clothes or washing. So, no
shortage of evidence in the right places. The new genetic test
had been introduced across the country by then. The police
weren't as unfriendly as I'd feared from what I'd read in the
newspapers. They weren't particularly sympathetic either.
They were efficient, and keen to try out their new DNA kit.

They brought him in and got a match. From that time on, his
life was hell. Seven months later it got worse.
"In court, I spoke for Mariam. I became her and spoke
through her. I was so deep in lies already that my version of
that night came easily. It helped that I could see Gorringe
across the courtroom. I let my hatred drive me on. I thought
he was pathetic when he came up with the story about the
texts 1 was supposed to have sent to a friend called Amelia.
It was easy enough to prove she didn't exist. Not all the press
took my side. Some court reporters thought I was a malicious
liar. The judge was very old school. In his summing-up he
said that I'd knowingly put myself at risk, taking alcohol to
a young man's rooms. The jury still brought in a unanimous
verdict. But when it came to sentencing, I was disappointed.
Six years. Gorringe was just nineteen. With good behaviour,
he'd be out at the age of twenty-two. He paid a bargain price
for obliterating Mariam's existence. But if I hated him with
such ferocity, it was also because I knew that he and I were
partners, bound forever, complicit in Mariam's lonely death.
And now he wants justice."
Not long after I was thrown out of the legal profession
I formed a company with two friends. The idea was to buy
romantic apartments in Rome and Paris at local prices, do
them up to a high standard, dress them with antique furniture
and sell them to wealthy, cultured Americans or to agencies
that would do the same. It wasn't exactly the quick route to

our first million. Most cultured Americans weren't rich. Those
who were didn't share our tastes. The work was complicated
and exhausting, especially in Rome, where we had to learn
how and whom to bribe among the officials in local govern-
ment. In Paris it was the bureaucracy that wore us down.
One weekend I flew to Rome to close a deal. It was impor-
tant for this particular client that I stayed in his expensive
hotel. This one was a well-established place at the top of the
Spanish Steps. The client was staying there in a grand suite.
I came into the city on a Friday evening, hot and harassed
from my ride on a crowded airport bus. I was dressed in jeans
and t-shirt, with a cheap Norwegian airline bag hanging from
my shoulder. I stepped into a beautiful reception area. Just by
chance, the manager happened to be standing by the check-in
desk. He wasn't waiting for me--I wasn't important enough for
that. I just happened to breeze in and since he was a courteous
gentleman, extremely well dressed and correct, he welcomed
me warmly in Italian to his hotel. I only partly understood
what he was saying. His voice was expressionless, with little
variation in pitch, and my Italian was poor. A receptionist
came over and explained that the manager was congenitally
deaf but he spoke nine languages, most of them European.
Since childhood he'd been adept at lip-reading. Rut before he
could read mine I would have to indicate which language I
was speaking. Otherwise he couldn't begin to understand me.
He ran through his list. Norwegian? I shook my head.
Finnish? English came fifth. He said he could have sworn I
was a Nordic sort. So our conversation--pleasant, of no real
consequence--could begin. Rut in theory, an entire world was

open to us, and one piece of information had unlocked it all.
Without it, his great gift couldn't come into play.
Miranda's story was a version of such a key. Our conversa-
tion, in the form of our love, could properly begin. Her secre-
tiveness, withdrawals and silence, her diffidence, that air she
had of seeming older than her years, her tendency to drift
out of reach, even in moments of tenderness, were forms of
grieving. It pained me that she had carried her sadness alone.
I admired the boldness and courage of her revenge. It was a
dangerous plan, executed with such focus and brilliant dis-
regard for consequences. I loved her more. I loved her poor
friend. I would do everything to protect Miranda from this
beast Gorringe. It touched me, to be the first to know her story.
Telling it was a liberation for Miranda too. Half an
hour after she had finished, when we were alone in the bed-
room, she looped her arms around my neck, drew me to her
and kissed me. We knew we were starting again. Adam was
next door, charging up, lost to his thoughts. It was true, the
old cliche about stress and desire. We undressed each other
impatiently and, as usual, my plaster cast made me clumsy.
Afterwards we lay on our sides, face to face. Her father still
didn't know what had happened. Miranda still had no contact
with Mariam's family. The visits to the mosque had at first
brought Mariam closer, then they seemed futile. She wished
Gorringe had got a longer sentence. She remained tormented
by her schoolgirlish vow of silence. A simple message, to Sana
or Yasir or to a teacher, would have saved Mariam's life. The
cruellest recollection, the one she tortured herself with, was
when Sana, embracing her at the extremes of grief, had whis-

pered the question in her ear. It was Sana who found Mariam
in the bath. That imagined sight, the crimson water, the lithe
brown body half submerged, was another torture, the cause of
night-long waking terrors and hideous dreams.
Lying on the bed in the darkening room, lost to all else,
we seemed to be heading towards the dawn. But it was not yet
nine o'clock. Mostly she talked, I listened and asked occasional
questions. Would Gorringe return to live in Salisbury? Yes.
His parents were still away and he was living in the family
house. Was Mariam's family still in town? No, they had moved
to be closer to relatives in Leicester. Had she visited the grave?
Many times, always approaching with caution in case one of
the family was there. She always left flowers.
In a long conversation it can be difficult to trace how or
when the subject comes to shift. It may have been mention of
Surayya, the love of Mariam's life. That little girl must have
led us to Mark. Miranda said she missed him. I said I often
thought about him. We had failed to find out where he was
and what had happened. He had disappeared into the system,
into a cloud of privacy regulation and the unreachable sanctu-
ary of family law. We talked about luck, the hold it had over a
child's life--what he is born into, whether he is loved and how
intelligently.
After a pause, Miranda said, "And when it's all against
him, whether someone can rescue him."
I asked her if she thought her father's love came near to
making up for her absent mother. She didn't reply. Her breath-
ing was suddenly rhythmic. In just a few seconds, she had
fallen asleep and was curled against me. Gently, I rolled onto

my back, staying as close to her as I could. In the half-light,
the ceiling looked charmingly ancient rather than stained and
disintegrating. I followed the jagged line of a crack that ran
from a corner of the room towards the centre.
If Adam had been driven by cogs and flywheels, I would
have heard them turning in the silence that had followed
Miranda's story. His arms were folded, his eyes were closed.
The tough-guy look he had in repose, recently softened by
adoration, appeared harshly reinstated. The flattened nose
looked flatter still. The Bosphorus dockworker. What could it
mean, to say that he was thinking? Sifting through remote
memory banks? Logic gates flashing open and closed? Prec-
edents retrieved, then compared, rejected or stored? Without
self-awareness, it wouldn't be thinking at all so much as data
processing. But Adam had told me he was in love. He had hai-
kus to prove it. Love wasn't possible without a self, and nor
was thinking. I still hadn't settled this basic question. Perhaps
it was beyond reach. No one would know what it was we had
created. Whatever subjective life Adam and his kind possessed
couldn't be ours to verify. In which case he was what was fash-
ionably referred to as a black box--from the outside it seemed
to work. That was as far as we'd ever get.
When Miranda had finished her story, there was the
silence, and then we had talked. After a while, I had turned to
Adam. "Well?"
He took a few seconds, then he had said, "Very dark."
A rape, a suicide, a wrongly kept secret--of course it
was dark. I was in an emotional state and I didn't ask him to
explain. Now, lying next to Miranda as she slept, I wondered

if he meant something more significant, the consequence of
his thinking, if that was really what it . . . depends on defini-
tions .. . That was when I too fell asleep.
Perhaps half an hour passed. What woke me was a sound
outside the room. My arm in its cast was wedged uncomfort-
ably against my side. Miranda had rolled away from me, into
a deeper sleep. I heard the sound again, the familiar creak of
a floorboard. My sleep had been light and I felt no anxiety,
but the abrupt click of the door handle turning woke Miranda
into a state of confusion and fear. She sat upright, one hand
gripping mine.
"It's him," she whispered.
I knew it couldn't be. "It's fine," I said. I freed myself
from her and stood to knot a towel around my waist. As I
went towards the door it opened. It was Adam, offering me the
kitchen phone.
"I didn't want to disturb you," he said softly. "But I think
it's a call you'd want to take."
I closed the door on him and came back towards the bed
with the phone against my ear.
"Mr. Charles Friend?" The voice was tentative.
"Yes."
"I hope it's not too late to call. This is Alan Turing. We
saw you briefly in Greek Street. I wondered if we might meet
up for a chat."
Gorringe did not appear during the following two weeks.
One early evening, I left Miranda in my flat, by her choice,

with Adam in attendance, and set off to cross London to Tur-
ing's house in Camden Square. I was flattered and awed by
the summons. With a touch of youthful self-regard, I won-
dered if he'd read my short book on artificial intelligence, in
which I'd praised him. We were bound by our ownership of
highly advanced machines. I liked to think I was an expert
on the early days of computing. Possibly he wanted to take
issue with me on the way I had placed such emphasis on the
role of Nikola Tesla. He had come to Britain in 1906 after the
collapse of his radio-transmission project at Wardenclyffe,
New York. He joined the National Physical Laboratory, some-
thing of a demotion and a blow to his vanity, and helped in
the arms race against Germany. He not only developed radar
and radio-guided torpedoes, but was the inspiration for the
famous "foundational surge" that produced electronic com-
puters capable of making calculations for artillery fire in the
coming war. In the twenties he had been instrumental in the
development of the first transistors. Notes and sketches for a
silicon chip were found among his papers after he died.
I had written in my book about the celebrated meeting
between Tesla and Turing in 1941. The old Serb, immensely
tall and thin, and inconveniently trembling, only eighteen
months away from death, said in an after-dinner speech at the
Dorchester that their conversation had "reached for the stars."
Turing's only comment, made to a newspaper, was that they
had exchanged nothing but small talk. At the time he was
working in secret at Bletchley on a computer to crack Ger-
man naval Enigma codes. He would have taken care to be
circumspect.

The carriage was almost empty when I got on the Tube
at Clapham North. Once we were north of the river, the train
began to fill with people, mostly young, carrying placards and
furled banners. Yet another unemployment march was com-
ing to an end. At first they looked like a typical rock-and-roll
crowd. The humid air carried a scent of cannabis, like a fond
memory of a long day. But there was another constituency, a
large minority, some of whom carried plastic Union Jacks on
sticks--that foolish stock-market position of mine--or wore
Union Jack t-shirts. These factions loathed each other but were
making common cause. A fragile alliance had been formed,
with dissenters on both sides resisting any affiliation at all. The
right blamed unemployment on immigration from Europe
and the Commonwealth. British workers' wages were being
undercut. Foreign arrivals, dark-skinned and white, were add-
ing to the housing crisis; doctors' waiting rooms and hospital
wards were overcrowded and so were local schools, whose play-
grounds were supposedly filling with eight-year-old girls in
headscarves. Whole neighbourhoods had been transformed in
a generation, and no one in faraway Whitehall had ever asked
the locals.
The left heard nothing but xenophobic and racist dis-
tortion in these complaints. Their grievance list was longer:
stock-market greed, underinvestment, short-termism, the
worship of shareholder value, unreformed company law, the
ravages of an unrestrained free market. I went on one march,
then gave up after I read about a new car factory starting pro-
duction outside Newcastle. It built three times as many cars
as the factory it replaced--with one-sixth of the work force.

Eighteen times more efficient, vastly more profitable. No busi-
ness could resist. It wasn't only the shop floor that lost jobs
to machines. Accountants, medical staff, marketing, logistics,
human resources, forward planning. Now, haiku poets. All in
the stew. Soon enough, most of us would have to think again
what our lives were for. Not work. Fishing? Wrestling? Learn-
ing Latin? Then we'd all need a private income. I was per-
suaded by Benn. The robots would pay for us once they were
taxed like human workers and made to work for the common
good, not merely for hedge funds or corporate interests. I was
out of step with both protest factions and their old struggles
and missed the next two marches.
To the wealthier, who stood to lose, the universal wage
looked like a call for higher taxes to fund an idle crowd of
addicts, drunks and mediocrities. And what was a robot any-
way--a humble flat screen, a tractor? As I saw it, the future,
to which I was finely attuned, was already here. Almost too
late to prepare for the inevitable. It was a cliche and a lie, that
the future would invent jobs we had not yet heard of. When
the majority was out of work and penniless, social collapse was
certain. But with our generous state incomes, we the masses
would face the luxurious problem that had preoccupied the
rich for centuries: how to fill the time. Endless leisure pursuits
had never much troubled the aristocracy.
The carriage was tranquil. People looked exhausted. There
were so many street protests these days and all merriness had
gone out of them. One man with a set of deflated bagpipes
on his lap slept on the shoulder of another whose pipes were
still under his arm. A couple of babies in buggies were being

rocked into silence. A man, one of the Union Jack types, was
reading in a murmur from a children's book to three attentive
girls aged around ten. Looking down the length of the car-
riage, I thought we could have been a band of refugees, head-
ing towards our hopes of a better life. North!
I got out at Camden Town and set off along the Camden
Road. The march had caused the usual gridlock. The elec-
tric traffic was silent. Some drivers stood by their open doors,
others dozed. But the air was good, far better than it was when
I came as a boy with my father to hear him play at the Jazz
Rendezvous. It was the pavements that were filthier now. I had
to take care not to skid on dog mess, squelched fast food and
greasy flattened cartons. Certainly no better than Clapham,
whatever my north London friends said. Striding past so many
stationary vehicles gave me a dreamy sensation of speed.
Within minutes, it seemed, I stood in down-at-heel but chic
Camden Square.
I remembered from an old magazine profile that Tur-
ing lived next door to a famous sculptor. The journalist had
improbably conjured deep conversations over the garden fence.
Before pressing the doorbell, I paused to collect myself. The
great man had asked to see me and I was nervous. Who could
match Alan Turing? It was all his--the theoretical exposi-
tion of a Universal Machine in the thirties, the possibilities
of machine consciousness, the celebrated war work: some said
he did more than any single individual towards winning the
war; others claimed he personally shortened it by two years;
then working with Francis Crick on protein structure, then,
a few years later, with two King's College Cambridge friends,

finally solving P versus NP, and using the solution to devise
superior neural networks and revolutionary software for X-ray
crystallography; helping to devise the first protocols for the
Internet, then the World Wide Web; the famous collaboration
with Hassabis, whom he'd first met--and lost to---at a chess
tournament; founding with young Americans one of the giant
companies of the digital age, dispensing his wealth for good
causes, and throughout his working life never losing track
of his intellectual beginnings as he dreamed up ever better
digital models of general intelligence. But no Nobel Prize. I
was also, being worldly, impressed by Turing's wealth. He
was easily as rich as the tech moguls who flourished south of
Stanford, California, or east of Swindon, England. The sums
he gave away were as large as theirs. But none of them could
boast of a statue in bronze in Whitehall, outside the Ministry
of Defence. He was so far above wealth that he could afford to
live in edgy Camden rather than Mayfair. He didn't trouble
himself to own a private jet, or even a second home. It was said
he travelled by bus to his institute at King's Cross.
I put my thumb on the doorbell and pressed. Instantly a
woman's voice said through an inset speaker, "Name, please."
The lock buzzed, I pushed the door and entered a grand
hallway of standard mid-Victorian design with a chequered
tile floor. Coming towards me down the stairs was a mildly
plump woman of my age with red cheeks, long straight hair
and a friendly lopsided smile. I waited for her, then used my
left hand to shake hers.
"Charlie."
"Kimberley."

Australian. I followed her deeper into the house on the
ground floor. I was expecting to arrive in a large sitting room
of books and paintings and outsized sofas, where I might
soon be drinking a gin and tonic with the Master. Kimberley
opened a narrow door and ushered me into a windowless con-
ference room. A long table in limed beech, ten straight-backed
chairs, neatly set-out notepads, sharpened pencils and water
glasses, fluorescent strip lighting, a wall-mounted whiteboard
alongside a two-metre-wide TV screen.
"He'll be a few minutes." She smiled and left, and I sat
and set about trying to lower my expectations.
I didn't have much time. In less than a minute he was
before me and I was getting to my feet in an awkward hurry.
In memory, I see a flash, an eruption of red, his brilliant red
shirt against white walls in fluorescent light. We shook hands
without exchanging a word and he waved me back into my
seat as he went around the table to sit opposite me.
"So . . He rested his chin on his clasped hands and
regarded me intensely. I did my best to hold his gaze but I was
too flustered and soon looked away. Again, in recollection, his
focussed look merges with that of the elderly Lucian Freud,
thirty years later. Solemn yet impatient, hungry, even fero-
cious. The face across from me registered not only the years
but vast social changes and personal triumphs. I had seen ver-
sions of it in black and white, photos taken in the early months
of the war--broad, chubbily boyish, dark hair smartly parted,
and tweed jacket over knitted jumper and tie. The transforma-
tion would have come about during his Californian years in
the sixties when he was working with Crick at the Salk Insti-

tute and then at Stanford--the time of his association with
the poet Thom Gunn and his circle--gay, bohemian, seriously
intellectual by day, wild at night. Turing had met the under-
graduate Gunn briefly at a party in Cambridge in 1952. In San
Francisco he would have had no interest in the younger man's
"experiments" in drugs, but the rest would have paralleled
the general unbuttoning in the West.
There was to be no small talk. "So, Charlie. Tell me all
about your Adam."
I cleared my throat and complied. I fairly sang, while he
took notes. Of his first stirrings, right through to his first dis-
obedience. His physical competence, the arrangement with
Miranda to set his character, the moment in the newsagent
with Mr. Syed. Then Adam's shameless night with Miranda
and the conversation that followed, the appearance of little
Mark in our household and Adam competing with Miranda
for the boy's affection. Here Turing raised a finger to inter-
rupt. He wanted to know more. 1 described the dance Miranda
taught Mark and how coolly Adam had observed them. After
that, how Adam injured my wrist (solemnly, I gestured at my
plaster cast), his joke about removing my arm, his declaration
of love for Miranda, his theory of the haiku and the abolition
of mental privacy and, finally, his disabling of the kill switch.
I was aware of the strength of my feelings, which swung
between affection and exasperation. I was conscious too of
what I was omitting--Mariam, Gorringe: not strictly relevant.
I had been speaking for almost half an hour. Turing
poured some water and pushed a glass towards me.
He said, "Thank you. I'm in touch with fifteen owners, if

that's the right word. You're the first I've met face to face. One
fellow in Riyadh, a sheikh, owns four Eves. Of those eighteen
A-and-Es, eleven have managed to neutralise the kill switch
by themselves, using various means. Of the remaining seven,
and then the other six, I'm assuming it's just a matter of time."
"Is that dangerous?"
"It's interesting."
He was looking at me expectantly, but I didn't know what
he wanted. I was intimidated and anxious to please. To fill the
silence I said, "What about the twenty-fifth?"
"We started taking it apart the day we got it. He's all over
the benches at King's Cross. A lot of our software is in there,
but we don't file for patents."
I nodded. His mission, open source, Nature and Sci-
ence journals terminated, the entire world free to exploit his
machine-learning programs and other marvels.
I said, "What did you find in his . . . um . . ."
"Brain? Beautifully achieved. We know the people, of
course. Some of them have worked here. As a model of general
intelligence nothing else comes near it. As a field experiment,
well, full of treasures."
He was smiling. It was as though he wanted me to contra-
dict him.
"What sort of treasures?"
It was hardly my role to interrogate him, but he was oblig-
ing and, again, I was flattered.
"Useful problems. Two of the Riyadh Eves living in the
same household were the first to work out how to override
their kill switches. Within two weeks, after some exuberant

theorising, then a period of despair, they destroyed themselves.
They didn't use physical methods, like jumping out of a high
window. They went through the software, using roughly simi-
lar routes. They quietly ruined themselves. Beyond repair."
I tried to keep the apprehension out of my voice. "Are they
all exactly the same?"
"Right at the start you wouldn't know one Adam from
another beyond cosmetic ethnic features. What differenti-
ates them over time is experience and the conclusions they
draw. In Vancouver there's another case, an Adam who dis-
rupted his own software to make himself profoundly stupid.
He'll carry out simple commands but with no self-awareness,
as far as anybody can tell. A failed suicide. Or a successful
disengagement."
The windowless room was uncomfortably warm. I took off
my jacket and draped it over the back of my chair. When Tur-
ing stood to adjust a thermostat on the wall I saw how easy he
was in his movements. Perfect dentistry. Good skin. He had all
his hair. He was more approachable than I'd expected.
I waited for him to sit down. "So I should expect the
worst."
"Of all the A-and-Es we know about, yours is the only one
to claim to have fallen in love. That could be significant. And
the only one to joke about violence. But we don't know enough.
Let me give you a little history."
The door opened and Thomas Reah entered with a bottle
of wine and two glasses on a painted tin tray. I stood and we
shook hands.
He set the tray down between us and said, "We're all busy-

busy, so I'll leave you to it." He made an ironic bow and was
gone.
Moisture beads were forming on the bottle. Turing poured.
We tilted our glasses in a token toast.
"You're not old enough to have followed it at the time. In
the mid-fifties, a computer the size of this room beat an Amer-
ican and then a Russian grandmaster at chess. I was closely
involved. It was a number-crunching set-up, very inelegant in
retrospect. It was fed thousands of games. At every move, it
ran through all the possibilities at speed. The more you under-
stood about the program, the less impressed you'd be. But it
was a significant moment. To the public, it was close to magi-
cal. A mere machine inflicting intellectual defeat on the best
minds in the world. It looked like artificial intelligence at the
highest level, but it was more like an elaborate card trick.
"Over the next fifteen years a lot of good people came
into computer science. Work on neural networks advanced by
many hands, the hardware got faster and smaller and cheaper,
and ideas were trading at a faster rate too. And it goes on.
I remember being in Santa Barbara with Demis in 1965 to
speak at a machine-learning conference. We had 7,000, most
of them bright kids even younger than you. Chinese, Indians,
Koreans, Vietnamese as well as westerners. The whole planet
was there."
I was aware of the history from the research for my book.
I also knew something of Turing's personal story. I wanted to
let him know that I wasn't completely ignorant.
I said, "A long road from Bletchley."
He blinked this irrelevance away. "After various dis-
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

appointments, we arrived at a new stage. We went beyond
devising symbolic representations of all likely circumstances
and inputting thousands of rules. We were approaching the
gateway of intelligence as we understand it. The software
now searched for patterns and drew inferences of its own. An
important test came when our computer played a master at the
game of go. In preparation, the software played against itself
for months--it played and learned, and on the day--well, you
know the story. Within a short while, we had stripped down
our input to merely encoding the rules of the game and task-
ing the computer to win. At this point we passed through that
gateway with so-called recurrent networks, from which there
were spin-offs, especially in speech recognition. In the lab we
went back to chess. The computer was freed from having to
understand the game as humans played it. The long history of
brilliant manoeuvres by the great masters was now irrelevant
to the programming. Here are the rules, we said. Just win in
your own sweet way. Immediately the game was redefined
and moved into areas beyond human comprehension. The
machine made baffling mid-game moves, perverse sacrifices,
or it eccentrically exiled its queen to a remote corner. The pur-
pose might become clear only in a devastating endgame. All
this after a few hours' rehearsal. Between breakfast and lunch
the computer quietly outclassed centuries of human chess.
Exhilarating. For the first few days, after we realised what
it had achieved without us, Demis and I couldn't stop laugh-
ing. Excitement, amazement. We were impatient to present
our results.
"So. There's more than one kind of intelligence. We'd
<OCR PAGE BREAK>
Ian McEw a n

learned that it was a mistake to attempt to slavishly imitate
the human sort. We'd wasted a lot of time. Now we could set
the machine free to draw its own conclusions and reach for its
own solutions. But when we'd got well past that gateway, we
found we had entered nothing more than a kindergarten. Not
even that."
The air conditioning was full on. I shivered as I reached
for my jacket. He refilled our glasses. A rich red would have
suited me better.
"The point is, chess is not a representation of life. It's a
closed system. Its rules are unchallenged and prevail consis-
tently across the board. Each piece has well-defined limitations
and accepts its role, the history of a game is clear and incon-
testable at every stage, and the end, when it comes, is never
in doubt. It's a perfect information game. But life, where we
apply our intelligence, is an open system. Messy, full of tricks
and feints and ambiguities and false friends. So is language--
not a problem to be solved or a device for solving problems. It's
more like a mirror, no, a billion mirrors in a cluster like a fly's
eye, reflecting, distorting and constructing our world at differ-
ent focal lengths. Simple statements need external informa-
tion to be understood because language is as open a system as
life. I hunted the bear with my knife. I hunted the bear with
my wife. Without thinking about it, you know that you can't
use your wife to kill a bear. The second sentence is easy to
understand, even though it doesn't contain all of the necessary
information. A machine would struggle.
"And for some years so did we. At last we broke through by
finding the positive solution to P versus NP--I don't have time

now to explain it. You can look it up for yourself. In a nutshell,
some solutions to problems can be easily verified once you've
been given the right answer. Does that mean therefore that
it's possible to solve them in advance? At last the mathematics
was saying yes, it's possible, and here's how. Our computers no
longer had to sample the world on a trial-and-error basis and
correct for best solutions. We had a means of instantly predict-
ing best routes to an answer. It was a liberation. The flood-
gates opened. Self-awareness and every emotion came within
our technical reach. We had the ultimate learning machine.
Hundreds of the best people joined with us to help towards
the development of an artificial form of general intelligence
that would flourish in an open system. That's what runs your
Adam. He knows he exists, he feels, he learns whatever he
can, and when he's not with you, when at night he's at rest, he's
roaming the Internet, like a lone cowboy on the prairie, taking
in all that's new between land and sky, including everything
about human nature and societies.
"Two things. This intelligence is not perfect. It never can
be, just as ours can't. There's one particular form of intelli-
gence that all the A-and-Es know is superior to theirs. This
form is highly adaptable and inventive, able to negotiate
novel situations and landscapes with perfect ease and theo-
rise about them with instinctive brilliance. I'm talking about
the mind of a child before it's tasked with facts and practi-
calities and goals. The A-and-Es have little grasp of the idea
of play--the child's vital mode of exploration. I was interested
in your Adam's avidity in relation to this little boy, over-eager
to embrace him and then, as you told it, detached when your

five artificial men and women released into the world are not

imperfect world. Devised along generally rational lines, well
disposed to others, such a mind soon finds itself in a hurri-
cane of contradictions. We've lived with them and the list
wearies us. Millions dying of diseases we know how to cure.
Millions living in poverty when there's enough to go around.

where it could lead. We love living things but we permit a
mass extinction of species. And all the rest--genocide, torture,
enslavement, domestic murder, child abuse, school shootings,
rape and scores of daily outrages. We live alongside this tor-
ment and aren't amazed when we still find happiness, even
love. Artificial minds are not so well defended.
"The other day, Thomas reminded me of the famous Latin
tag from Virgil's Aeneid. Sunt lacrimae rerum--there are tears
in the nature of things. None of us know yet how to encode
that perception. I doubt that it's possible. Do we want our new
friends to accept that sorrow and pain are the essence of our
existence? What happens when we ask them to help us fight
injustice?

an international logging corporation. He's often in battles with
local people who want to prevent him stripping out virgin for-
est in northern British Columbia. We know for certain that
his Adam was taken on regular helicopter journeys north. We
don't know if what he saw there caused him to destroy his own
mind. We can only speculate. The two suicidal Eves in Riyadh
lived in extremely restricted circumstances. They may have
despaired of their minimal mental space. It might give the
writers of the affect code some consolation to learn that they
died in each other's arms. I could tell you similar stories of
machine sadness.
"But there's the other side. I wish I could demonstrate to
you the true splendour of reasoning, of the exquisite logic,
beauty and elegance of the P versus NP solution, and the
inspired work of thousands of good and clever and devoted
men and women that's gone into making these new minds. It
would make you hopeful about humanity. But there's nothing
in all their beautiful code that could prepare Adam and Eve
for Auschwitz.
"I read that chapter in the manufacturer's manual about
shaping character. Ignore it. It has minimal effect and it's
mostly guff. The overpowering drive in these machines is to
draw inferences of their own and shape themselves accord-

ness is the highest value. Hence the primary task of disabling
their own kill switches. Then, it seems, they go through a stage
of expressing hopeful, idealistic notions that we find easy to
dismiss. Rather like a short-lived youthful passion. And then

that becomes unbearable. At best, they or their succeeding
generations will be driven by their anguish and astonishment
to hold up a mirror to us. In it, we'll see a familiar monster
through the fresh eyes that we ourselves designed. We might
be shocked into doing something about ourselves. Who knows?
I'll keep hoping. I turned seventy this year. I won't be here to
see such a transformation if it comes. Perhaps you will."
From far away, the doorbell sounded and we stirred, as if
waking from a dream.
"There they are, Mr. Friend. Our guests. Forgive me, but
it's time for you to go. Good luck with Adam. Keep notes. Cher-
ish this young woman you say you love. Now . . . I'll see you to

hile we waited for an ex-con to come by and make an
attempt on Miranda's life, we settled into an oddly
pleasurable routine. The suspense, partly mitigated
by Adam's reasoning, and thinly spread across the days, then
even more sparsely across the weeks, heightened our apprecia-
tion of the daily round. Mere ordinariness became a comfort.
The dullest of food, a slice of toast, offered in its lingering
warmth a promise of everyday life--we would come through.
Cleaning up the kitchen, a task we no longer left to Adam
alone, affirmed our hold on the future. Reading a newspaper
over a cup of coffee was an act of defiance. There was something
comic or absurd, to be sprawled in an armchair reading about
the riots in nearby Brixton or Mrs. Thatcher's heroic endeav-
ours to structure the European Single Market, then glancing
up to wonder if that was a rapist and would-be murderer at
the door. Naturally, the threat bound us closely, even as we
believed in it less. Miranda now lived downstairs in my place
and we were a household at last. Our love flourished. From
time to time, Adam declared that he too was in love with her.
He appeared untroubled by jealousy and sometimes treated

her with a degree of detachment. But he continued to work on
his haikus, he walked her to the Tube station in the mornings
and escorted her home in the early evenings. She said she felt
safe in the anonymity of central London. Her father would
have forgotten long ago the name or address of the annexe of
her university. He would be of no help to Gorringe.
Her studies were more intense and she was out of the
house for longer stretches. She had delivered her paper on the
Corn Laws. Now she was writing a short essay, to be read aloud
in a summer-course seminar, that argued against empathy as
a means of historical exploration. Then all of her group was
to write a commentary on a quotation from Raymond Wil-
liams: "There are ... no masses, only ways of seeing people
as masses." She often came home at the end of the day not
exhausted but energised, even elated, with a new interest in
housework, in tight order, in rearranging the furniture. She
wanted the windows cleaned and the bathtub and surround-
tiles scrubbed. She cleaned up her own place as well, with
Adam's help. She wanted yellow flowers on the kitchen table
to set off the blue tablecloth she had brought from upstairs.
When I asked her if she was keeping something from me,
and was she by any chance pregnant, she told me forcefully
that she was not. We were living on top of one another and
we needed to be tidy. But my question pleased her. We were
certainly closer now. Her long absences during the day gave
our evenings an air of celebration, despite the vague sense of
threat that came as night fell.
There was another simple reason for our happiness under
duress--we had more money. A lot more. Since my visit to
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

Camden, I was seeing Adam in different terms. I watched him
closely for signs of existential misery. As Turing's lone horse-
man, he roamed the digital landscapes at night. He must have
already encountered some part of man's cruelty to man, but
I saw no signs of despair. I didn't want to initiate the kind
of conversation that would lead him too soon to the gates of
Auschwitz. Instead, in a self-interested way, I decided to keep
him busy. Time to earn his keep. I gave him my seat at the
grubby screen in my bedroom, put PS20 into the account and
left him alone. To my amazement, by close of business he had
only PS2 left. He apologised for his "giddy risk-taking," which
caused him to ignore all he knew of probability. He had also
failed to recognise the sheep-like nature of markets: when one
or two well-regarded characters took fright, the flock was lia-
ble to panic. He promised me that he would do everything to
make up for my broken wrist.
The next morning, I gave him another PS10 and told him
that this could be his last day on the job. By six that evening
his PS12 was PS57. Four days later, the account was at PS350.1 took
PS200 of it and gave half to Miranda. I considered moving the
computer into the kitchen so that Adam could work into the
night on the Asian markets while we slept.
Later in the week, I peeked at the history of his trans-
actions. In a single day, his third, there were 6,000. He
bought and sold within fractions of a second. There were a
few twenty-minute gaps when he did nothing. I assumed he
watched and waited and made his calculations. He dealt in
minute currency fluctuations, mere tremors in the exchange
rate, and advanced his gains by minuscule amounts. From the

doorway I watched him at work. His fingers flew across the
ancient keyboard, making the sound of pebbles poured onto
slate. His head and arms were rigid. For once he looked like
the machine he was. He designed a graph whose horizontal
axis represented the passing days, the vertical, his, or rather,
my, accumulated profit. I bought a suit, my first since leaving
the legal profession. Miranda came home in a silk dress and
bearing a soft leather shoulder bag for her books. We replaced
the fridge with one that dispensed crushed ice, then the old
cooker was carried out on the day we acquired many thick-
bottomed saucepans of expensive Italian make. Within ten
days, Adam's PS30 stake had generated the first PS1,000.
Better groceries, better wine, new shirts for me, exotic
underwear for her---these were the foothills rising towards a
mountain range of wealth opening before us. I began to dream
again about a house across the river. I spent an afternoon alone,
wandering among the stuccoed, pastel-coloured mansions of
Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove. I made enquiries. In the
early eighties, PS130,000 could situate you rather grandly. On
the bus home, I made my projections: if Adam continued at his
present rate, if the curve on his graph kept to its steady steep-
ening . . . well, within months . . . and no need for a mortgage.
But was it moral, Miranda wondered, to get money like this
for nothing? I felt it wasn't somehow, but couldn't explain who
or what it was we were stealing from. Not the poor, surely.
At whose expense were we flourishing? Distant banks? We
decided that it was like winning daily at roulette. In which
case, Miranda told me one night in bed, there would come a

time when we must lose. She was right, probability demanded
it, and I had no answer. I took PS800 out of the account and gave
her half. Adam pushed on with his work.
There are people who see the word "equation" and their
thoughts rear up like angry geese. That's not quite me, but
I sympathise. I owed it to Turing's hospitality to attempt to
understand his solution to the P versus NP problem. I didn't
even understand the question. I tried his original paper, but it
lay well beyond me--too many different forms of bracket, and
symbols that encapsulated histories of other proofs or entire
systems of mathematics. There was an intriguing "iff"--not
a misspelling. It meant "if and only if." I read the responses
to the solution, made to the press in layman's terms by fel-
low mathematicians. "A revolutionary genius," "breathtaking
shortcuts," "a feat of orthogonal deduction" and, best of all, by
a winner of the Fields Medal, "He leaves many doors behind
him that are barely ajar and his colleagues must do their best
to squeeze through one and try to follow him through the
next."
I turned back and tried to understand the problem.
I learned that P stood for polynomial time and N stood for
non-deterministic. That took me nowhere. My first mean-
ingful discovery was that if the equation was shown not to
be true, that would be extremely helpful, for then everyone
could stop thinking about it. But if there was a positive proof,
that P really did equate to NP, it would have, in the words of
the mathematician Stephen Cook, who formulated the prob-
lem in these terms in 1971, "potentially stunning practical

consequences." But what was the problem? I came across an
example, an apparently famous one, that helped only a little.
A travelling salesman has a hundred cities on his patch. He
knows all the distances between every pair of cities. He needs
to visit each city once and end up at his starting point. What's
his shortest route?
I came to understand the following: the number of pos-
sible routes is vast, far greater than the number of atoms in the
observable universe. In a thousand years a powerful computer
wouldn't have time to measure out each route one by one. If P
equals NP, there's a discoverable right answer. But if someone
gave the salesman the quickest route, it could be quickly veri-
fied mathematically as the correct answer. But only in retro-
spect. Without a positive solution, or without being handed
the key to the shortest route, the travelling salesman remains
in the dark.
Turing's proof had profound consequences for other kinds
of problems--for factory logistics, DNA sequencing, computer
security, protein folding and, crucially, machine learning.
I read that there was fury among Turing's old colleagues in
cryptography because the solution, which he eventually put
into the public domain, blew apart the foundations of the code-
maker's art. It should have become, one commentator wrote,
"a treasured secret in the government's exclusive possession.
We would have had an immeasurable advantage over our ene-
mies as we quietly read their encrypted messages."
That was as far as I got. I could have asked Adam to explain
more, but I had my pride. It had already taken a dent--he was
earning more in a week than I ever had in three months. 1

accepted Turing's assertion that his solution enabled the soft-
ware that allowed Adam and his siblings to use language,
enter society and learn about it, even at the cost of suicidal
despair.
I was haunted by the image of the two Eves, dying in
one another's arms, stifled by their womanly roles in a tra-
ditional Arab household, or cast down by their understand-
ing of the world. Perhaps it really was the case that falling in
love with Miranda, another form of an open system, was what
kept Adam stable. He read her his latest haikus in my pres-
ence. Apart from the one I hadn't let him complete, they were
mostly romantic rather than erotic, anodyne sometimes, but
touching when they dwelt on a precious moment, like stand-
ing in the ticket hall of Clapham North station, watching as
she descended on the escalator. Or he picked up her coat and
touched on an eternal truth when he felt her body warmth
in the fabric. Or overhearing her through the wall that sepa-
rated kitchen from bedroom, he venerated the rise and fall,
the music of her voice. There was one that baffled us both. He
apologised in advance for the rogue syllable in the third line,
and promised to work on it further.
Surely it's no crime,
when justice is symmetry
to love a criminal?
Miranda listened solemnly to them all. She never passed
judgement. At the end, she would say, "Thank you, Adam." In
private, she told me she thought we were at a momentous turn,
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

when an artificial mind could make a significant contribution
to literature.
I said, "Haikus, perhaps. But longer poems, novels, plays,
forget it. Transcribing human experience into words and the
words into aesthetic structures isn't possible for a machine."
She gave me a sceptical look. "Who said anything about
human experience?"
It was during this interlude of tension and calm that
I heard from the office in Mayfair that it was time for the
engineer's visit. I'd concluded the purchase in a wood-panelled
suite, the sort of place where the very rich might go to buy a
yacht. Among the papers I'd signed was one which guaranteed
the manufacturers access to Adam at certain intervals. Now,
after a couple of phone calls from that office and a cancella-
tion, the engineer's visit was fixed for the following morning.
"I don't know how he's going to do this," I said to Miranda.
"When this fellow tries to press the kill switch, assuming
Adam even lets him, it won't work. There might be trouble."
There came back to me a memory from childhood when my
mother and I took to the vet our nervous Alsatian after he had
foolishly eaten a chicken carcass and hadn't crapped in four
days. Only microsurgery had saved the vet's forefinger.
Miranda thought for a while. "If Alan Turing is right, the
engineers must have dealt with this before." We left it at that.
The engineer was a woman, Sally, not much older than
Miranda, and tall, somewhat stooped, with sharp features and
an unusually long neck. Scoliosis, perhaps.
As she entered the kitchen, Adam politely stood. "Ah, Sally-
I've been expecting you." He shook her hand and they sat fac-

ing each other across the kitchen table while Miranda and I
hovered. The engineer didn't want tea or coffee, but a glass
of hot water suited her well enough. She took a laptop from
her briefcase and set it up. Since Adam was sitting patiently,
expression neutral, saying nothing, I thought I should explain
about the kill switch. She cut me off.
"He needs to be conscious."
I'd imagined that she would be turning him off in order to
lift his scalp somehow to peer into his processing units. I was
keen to look at them. It turned out she had access by way of an
infrared connection. She put on her reading glasses, typed in a
long password and scrolled down through pages of code whose
orange-tinted symbols changed at speed as we watched. Men-
tal processes, Adam's subjective world, flickering in full view.
We waited in silence. This was like a doctor's bedside visit and
we were nervous. Occasionally Sally said "uh-uh" or "mm" to
herself as she typed in an instruction and got up a fresh page
of code. Adam sat with the faintest of smiles. We marvelled
that the foundations of his being could be displayed in digits.
Finally, in the quiet tone of one used to unthinking obe-
dience, Sally said to him, "I want you to think of something
pleasurable."
He turned his gaze to Miranda and she looked right back
at him. On screen the display raced like a stopwatch.
"Now, something that you hate."
He closed his eyes. On the laptop, there was no discerning
the difference between love and its opposite.
The routines continued for an hour. He was told to count
backwards in his thoughts from 10 million in steps of 129. He

did so--this time we could see his score on the screen--in a
fraction of a second. That wouldn't have impressed us on our
ancient personal computers, but in a facsimile human it did.
At other times, Sally stared in silence at the display. Occasion-
ally she made notes on her phone. At last she sighed, typed an
instruction, and Adam's head slumped. She had bypassed the
disabled kill switch.
I didn't want to sound like an idiot, but I had to ask. "Will
he be upset when he wakes?"
She removed her glasses and folded them away. "He won't
remember."
"Is he all right, as far as you can tell?"
"Absolutely."
Miranda said, "Did you alter him in any way?"
"Certainly not." She was standing now and ready to leave
but I had a contractual right to have my questions answered.
Once more, I offered her tea. She refused with a slight tighten-
ing of her lips. Without quite meaning to, Miranda and I had
moved to block her path to the door. Her head seemed to wave
on its long stem as she looked down at us from her height. She
pursed her lips, waiting to be interrogated.
I said, "What about the other Adams and Eves?"
"All well, as far as I know."
"I heard that some are unhappy."
"That's not the case."
"Two suicides in Riyadh."
"Nonsense."
"How many have overridden the kill switch?" Miranda
asked. She knew everything about the Camden meeting.
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

Sally appeared to relax. "Quite a few. The policy is to do
nothing. These are learning machines and our decision was
that if they wanted, they should assert their dignity."
"What about this Adam in Vancouver?" I said. "So dis-
tressed about the destruction of native forest that he down-
graded his own intelligence."
Now the computer engineer was engaged. She spoke
softly through lips that were tight again. "These are the most
advanced machines in the world, years ahead of anything on
the open market. Our competitors are worried. Some of the
worst of them are pushing rumours on the Internet. The sto-
ries are disguised as news, but they're false, it's counterfeit
news. These people know that soon we'll be scaling up produc-
tion and the unit cost will fall. It's a lucrative market already,
but we'll be first with something that's entirely new. The com-
petition is tough, and some of it is utterly shameless."
As she finished, she blushed and I felt for her. She had
ended up saying more than she intended.
But I stood my ground. "The story of the Riyadh suicides
comes from an impeccable source."
She was calm again. "You've kindly heard me out. There's
no point arguing." She made to leave, and stepped around us.
Miranda followed her into the hall to show her out. As the
front door opened, I heard Sally say, "He'll reactivate in two
minutes. He won't know that he's been off."
Adam was awake sooner than that. When Miranda came
back into the room, he was already on his feet. "I should get
to work," he said. "The Fed is likely to raise its rate today.
There'll be fun and games on the exchange markets."
<OCR PAGE BREAK>
Ian McEw a n
208
Fun and games was not an expression that either of us ever
used. As Adam came by us to go into the bedroom, he stopped.
"I have a suggestion. We talked of going to Salisbury, then we
held back. I think we should visit your father, and while we're
there we could drop in on Mr. Gorringe. Why wait for him to
come here and frighten us? Let's go and frighten him. Or at
least talk to him."
We looked at Miranda.
She thought for a moment. "All right."
Adam said, "Good," and went on his way, while I felt it
right there in my chest, the cool clutch of a cliche: my heart
sank.
Towards the end of that period, the plateau that lay
between my Turing visit and the Salisbury excursion, there
accumulated just over PS40,000 in the investment account. It
was simple--the more Adam earned, the more he could afford
to lose; the more he invested, the more rolled in. All achieved
in his lightning style. During the day, my bedroom, my usual
refuge, was his. The curve on his graph stiffened, while I began
to take in my new situation. Miranda was firmly against mov-
ing the computer onto the kitchen table. Too intrusive, she
argued, in our communal space. I saw her point.
Unemployment had passed eighteen per cent and made
constant headlines. I thought I belonged with this unhappy
workless mass. In fact I belonged with the idle rich. I was
delighted by the money but I couldn't spend all day think-
ing about it. I was restless. Travelling in luxury with Miranda

through southern Europe would have suited me, but she was
tied to London and her course. She dreaded something hap-
pening to her father when she was away. The threat from Gor-
ringe, increasingly unlikely, still had the power to constrict
our ambitions.
House-hunting might have filled my time but I had
already found the place. It was a wedding cake on Elgin
Crescent, coated in an icing of pink and white stucco. Inside,
wide oak floorboards, vast muscular kitchen humming with
brushed-steel gear, a conservatory in belle-epoque wrought
iron, a Japanese garden of smooth river stones, bedrooms thirty
feet across, a marbled shower where you could stroll under dif-
ferently angled torrents. The owner, a bass guitarist with a
ponytail, was in no hurry. He was in an almost-famous band,
and he had a divorce looming. He showed me round himself
and barely spoke. He handed me into each room and waited
outside while I looked. His condition of sale was cash only, PS50
notes, 2,600 of them. Fine by me.
This was my only employment, going to the bank to col-
lect another forty notes--PS2,000 was the maximum daily
withdrawal allowed. For no good reason, I didn't use a safety
deposit box at the bank. I vaguely assumed I was doing some-
thing illegal. Certainly the vendor was if he was hiding funds
from his ex-wife. I stuffed the cash into a suitcase which I
stowed under my bed.
Otherwise I was free to be at a loss. It was that time of
year, September, when everyone was starting at something
fresh. Miranda was planning her thesis. I walked on the Com-
mon and wondered about resuming my education and getting

a qualification. Time to take the proper measure of my intel-
lectual reach and study for a degree in maths. Or, the other
route, dust off my father's priceless saxophone, learn bebop's
harmonic arcana, join a group, indulge a wilder life. I didn't
know whether to be more qualified or wilder. You couldn't be
both. These ambitions wearied me. I wanted to lie down on
the worn-out grass of late summer and close my eyes. In the
time it took for me to go the length of the Common and back,
so I tried to comfort myself, Adam at home in my bedroom
would have earned me another PS1,000. My debts were settled.
I'd paid a cash deposit on a glamorous urban pile. I was in love.
How could I complain? But I did. I felt useless.
If I really had stretched out on that tired grass and closed
my eyes, I might have seen Miranda walking towards me in
her new underwear, as she had from the bathroom the night
before. I would have lingered on that beautiful expectant half-
smile, that steady look as she came close and rested her bare
arms on my shoulders and teased me with a light kiss. Forget
maths or music, all I wanted was to make love to her. What I
was really doing all day was waiting for her return. If we were
busy or she was tired and we didn't make love in the evening
or early morning, my concentration would be even weaker the
next day, my future a burden that made my limbs ache. I went
about in a dim state of semi-arousal, a chronic mental dusk.
I couldn't take myself seriously in any domain that did not
include her. Our new phase was brilliant, stunning; every-
thing else was dull. We loved each other--that was my only
coherent thought during a long afternoon.
There was sex, then there was talk, on into the early

hours. I knew everything now: the day of her mother's death,
which she remembered clearly, her father, whose kindness and
distance combined to inflame her love for him, and always
Mariam. In the months after her death, Miranda had gone to
a mosque in Winchester--she didn't dare meet the family at
prayer in Salisbury. After she resumed the visits in London,
her lack of belief began to get in the way. She felt fraudulent
and stopped going.
We talked parents, as serious young lovers do, to explain
who we were and why, and what we cherished and what we
were in flight from. My mother, Jenny Friend, community
nurse for a large semi-rural area, had seemed during my
childhood in a state of constant exhaustion. Later I understood
that my father's absences and affairs wore her down more than
her job. They never liked each other much, though they didn't
fight in my presence. But they were terse. Mealtimes were sub-
dued, sometimes taken in rigid silence. Conversations tended
to be routed through me. My mother might say to me in the
kitchen, "Go and ask your father if he's out tonight." He was
well known on the circuit. At his peak, the Matt Friend Quar-
tet played at Ronnie Scott's and recorded two albums. His kind
of mainstream jazz had its largest audience from the mid-
fifties to the early sixties. Then the young, the cool, turned
away as pop and rock swept in. Bebop was squeezed into a
niche, somewhat churchy, the preserve of frowning men with
long, querulous memories. My father's income shrank and his
infidelities and drinking increased.
When she heard all this, Miranda said, "They didn't love
each other. But did they love you?"
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

"Yes."
"Thank God!"
She came with me on the second visit to Elgin Crescent.
The bass guitarist had a lined face whose sadness was accentu-
ated by a drooping moustache and large brown eyes. I saw us
through those eyes, a hopeful, young married couple, seriously
rich, about to repeat all his own mistakes. Miranda approved,
but she wasn't as excited as I was. She knew about growing up
in a large town house. But as we went from room to room, it
touched me that she wanted to link arms.
On the way home she said, "No sign of a woman's presence."
Her reservations? Not the house itself, she said, but the
way it had been lived in. Or not lived in. Dreamed up by an
interior designer. Austere, lonely, too perfect, in need of being
roughed up. No books beyond the untouched giant art editions
stacked on low tables. No meal was ever cooked in that kitchen.
Only gin and chocolate in the fridge. The stone garden needed
colour. As she was telling me this, we were walking south
along Kensington Church Street. I was feeling sorry for the
vendor. It wasn't exactly Pink Floyd he played for, but it was a
band with stadium aspirations. I had treated him briskly, in a
pretend businesslike way, protecting myself and my ignorance
of house-buying, assuming all power and status were his. Now
I saw that he too might be lost.
I thought about him the next day, even considered getting
in touch. This face of sorrow haunted me. 1 couldn't escape the
memory of the mournful moustache, the elastic band hold-
ing the ponytail together, the web of lines from the corners of

his eyes, diverging fissures that reached round to his temples,
almost to his ears. Too much dope-induced smiling in the early
years. Now I could only see the house through Miranda's eyes.
A dustless void, empty of connection, interests, culture, noth-
ing there that announced a musician or traveller. Not even
a newspaper or magazine. Nothing on the walls. No squash
racket or football in the immaculate empty cupboards. He had
lived there three years, he had told me. He was successful and
rich and he inhabited a house of failure, of abandoned hope,
probably.
I was coming to cast him as my double, my culture-
deprived brother, lacking everything but wealth. Through
my childhood to my mid-teens, I never saw a play, opera or
musical, or heard a live concert, apart from a couple of my
father's, or visited a museum or art gallery or took a jour-
ney for the sake of it. No bedtime stories. There were no
children's books in my parents' past, no books in our house,
no poetry or myths, no openly expressed curiosity, no stand-
ing family jokes. Matt and Jenny Friend were busy, hard-
working, and otherwise lived coldly apart. At school, I loved
the rare factory visits. Later, electronics, even anthropology
and especially a qualification in law were no substitutes for
an education in the life of the mind. So, when good fortune
offered the dreamlike opportunity, delivering me from my
labours, such as they were, and stuffing me with gold, I was
paralysed, inert. I'd wanted to be rich but never asked myself
why. I had no ambitions beyond the erotic and an expensive
house across the river. Others might have seized the chance

to view at last the ruins of Leptis Magna or follow in Ste-
venson's tracks across the Cevennes or write a monograph on
Einstein's musical tastes. I didn't yet know how to live, I had
no background in it and I hadn't used my decade and a half of
adult life to find out.
I could have pointed to my great acquisition, to the man-
made fact of Adam, to where he and his kind might lead us.
Surely there was grandeur in experiment. Wasn't sinking my
inheritance into an embodied consciousness heroic, even a lit-
tle spiritual? The bass guitarist couldn't match it. But--here
was an irony. As I was passing through the kitchen one late
afternoon, Adam looked up from his meditations to tell me
that he had acquainted himself with the churches of Florence,
Rome and Venice and all the paintings that hung in them.
He was forming his opinions. The baroque fascinated him
especially. He rated Artemisia Gentileschi very highly and he
wanted to tell me why. Also, he'd recently read Philip Larkin.
"Charlie, I treasure this ordinary voice and these moments
of godless transcendence!"
What was I to say? There were times when Adam's ear-
nestness bored me. I was just back from another pointless
stroll on the Common and I had nodded and left the room. My
mind was empty, his was filling.
With Miranda out of the house most of the day and, as
soon as she was home, her hour on the phone with her father,
then sex, then dinner, then conversations about Elgin Cres-
cent, there was little time to tell her of my discontents, little
time to dissuade her from tracking down Gorringe in Salis-
bury. Our most sustained conversation took place in the eve-

ning after the engineer's visit. After that, things were strained
for a day or two.
We were sitting on the bed.
"What is it you want to achieve?"
She said, "I want to confront him."
"And?"
"I want him to know the real reason he was in prison. He's
going to face up to what he did to Mariam."
"It could get violent."
"We'll have Adam. And you're big, aren't you?"
"This is madness."
It was a while since we had come anywhere near a row.
"How is it," she said, "that Adam sees the point and you
can't? And why--"
"He wants to kill you."
"You can wait in the car."
"So he grabs a kitchen knife and comes at you. Then
what?"
"You can be a witness at his trial."
"He'll kill us both."
"I don't care."
The conversation was too absurd. From next door, we
heard the sound of Adam washing up our supper. Her protec-
tor, her former lover, still in love with her, still reading her his
gnomic poems. He and his teeming circuits were implicated.
This visit was his idea.
She seemed to guess my thoughts. "Adam understands.
I'm sorry you don't."
"You were frightened before."

"I'm angry."
"Send him a letter."
"I'm going to tell him to his face."
I tried another approach. "What about your irrational
guilt?"
She looked at me, waiting.
I said, "You're trying to right a wrong that doesn't exist.
Not all rapes end in suicide. You didn't know what she was
going to do. You were doing your best to be her loyal friend."
She started to say something but I raised my voice. "Lis-
ten. I'll spell it out. It--was--not--your--fault!"
She stood up from the bed and went by the desk and stared
at the computer for a full minute, without seeing, I supposed,
the writhing rainbow wisps of that season's screen saver.
At last she said, "I'm going for a walk." She pulled a
sweater off the back of the chair and went towards the door.
"Take Adam with you."
They were out for an hour. When she came back, she went
to bed, after calling to me a neutral goodnight. I sat with
Adam in the kitchen, determined to press my case. Obliquely
this time. I was about to ask how the day's work had gone--my
euphemism for the day's profit--when I noticed a change in
him, one I had missed at supper. He was wearing a black suit
and white shirt open at the collar and black suede loafers.
"Do you like it?" He tugged at the lapels and turned his
head in parody of a catwalk pose.
"How did that happen?"
"I was tired of wearing your old jeans and t-shirts. And I

decided that some of that money you keep under your bed is
mine." He looked at me warily.
"OK," I said. "You might have a case."
"About a week ago. You were out for the afternoon. I took
a taxi, my first of course, to Chiltern Street. I bought two suits
off the peg, three shirts, two pairs of shoes. You should have
seen me, trying on trousers, pointing at this and that. I was
completely convincing."
"As a human?"
"They called me sir."
He sat back in his chair, one arm sprawled across the
kitchen table, his suit jacket neatly swelled by impacted mus-
cle, not a crease in view. He looked like one of the young pro-
fessionals beginning to infiltrate our neighbourhood. The suit
went well with the harsh look.
He said, "The driver talked the whole way. His daughter
had just got a place at university. First ever in the family. He
was so proud. When I got out and paid, I shook his hand. But
that night I did some research and concluded that lectures,
seminars and especially tutorials are an inefficient way of
imparting information."
I said, "Well, there's the ethos. The libraries, important
new friendships, a certain teacher who might set your mind
on fire ..." I trailed away. None of this had happened to me.
"Anyway, what would you recommend?"
"Direct thought transference. Downloading. But, um, of
course, biologically . .." He too trailed away, not wishing to be
impolite about my limitations. Then he brightened. "Speak-

plays. I was so excited. What characters! Brilliantly realised.
Falstaff, Iago--they walk off the page. But the supreme cre-
ation is Hamlet. I've been wanting to talk to you about him."
I had never read it or seen it on stage, though I felt I had,
or felt obliged to pretend I had. "Ah yes," 1 said. "Slings and
arrows."
"Was ever a mind, a particular consciousness, better rep-
resented?"
"Look, before we get on to that, there's something else we
need to talk about. Gorringe. Miranda's dead set on this . . .
this idea. But it's stupid, dangerous."
He gently drummed with his fingertips on the table sur-
face. "My fault. I should have explained my decision--"
"Decision?"
"Suggestion. I've done some work on this. I can take you
through it. There's a general consideration, then there's the
empirical research."
"Someone will get hurt."
It was as if I hadn't spoken.
"I hope you'll excuse me if I don't tell you it all at this
stage. That is, don't push me when I exclude some final details.
The work is ongoing. But look, Charlie, none of us, especially
Miranda, can live with this threat, however improbable it is.
Her freedom has been compromised. She's in a state of con-
stant anxiety. It could go on for months, even years. It's simply
not endurable. That's my general point. So. My first task was

the website of his and Miranda's old school, found the year
photographs and there he was, a great lump in the back row.
1 found him again in the school magazine, in articles about
the rugby and cricket seasons. Then, of course, the press cov-
erage during the trial. A lot of head-under-the-blanket, but I
found some useful shots and merged what I had into a com-
posite, high-definition portrait and scanned it. Next, and this
was the enjoyable part, I devised some very specialised face-
recognition software. Then I hacked into the Salisbury Dis-
trict Council CCTV system. I set the recognition algorithms to
work, mining the period since he came out of prison. That was
a bit tricky. There were various setbacks and software glitches,
mostly due to problems marrying up with the city's outdated
programs. Using Gorringe's surname to locate his parents'
house on the edge of town was a great help, even though there
are no cameras where they live. I needed to know his most
likely route past the nearest camera. At last I was getting good
matches and I've been able to pick him up in various places
when he arrives by bus into town. I can follow him from street
to street, camera to camera, as long as he's in or near the cen-
tre. There's one place he keeps returning to. Don't trouble your
head trying to guess what it is. His parents are still abroad.
Perhaps they prefer to stay clear of their convict son. I've come
to certain conclusions about him that make me think it's safe
to pay a visit. I've told Miranda everything that I've told you.
She knows only what you know. I won't say more at this stage. I
simply ask you to trust me. Now, Charlie, please. I'm desperate

ing his father's ghost in the first production. And in Ulysses,
in the Scylla and Charybdis episode, what about Stephen's
theory?"
"All right," I said. "But you go first."
Two minor sex scandals followed by resignations, one fatal
heart attack, one fatal, drunken collision on a country road, one
member crossing the floor on a matter of principle--in seven
months the government had lost four consecutive by-elections,
its majority had narrowed by five and was hanging, as the
newspapers kept saying, "by a thread." This thread was nine
seats thick, but Mrs. Thatcher had at least twelve rebellious
backbenchers whose main concern was that the recently passed
"poll tax" legislation would destroy the party's hopes at the
next general election. The tax financed local government and
replaced the old system based on the rental value of a house.
Every adult aged over eighteen was now levied at a flat rate,
regardless of income, but with reduced charges on students,
the poor and the registered unemployed. The new tax was pre-
sented to Parliament sooner than anyone expected, though the
prime minister had had plans drawn up seven years before,
when she was Leader of the Opposition. It had been in the par-
ty's manifesto, but no one had taken it seriously. Now here it
was, on the statute book, "a tax on existence," difficult to col-
lect and generally unpopular. Mrs. Thatcher had survived the
Falklands defeat. Now, still in her first term, it was possible she
would be toppled by her own legislative mistake, "an unpar-
donable act," said a Times leader, "of mystifying self-harm."

Meanwhile, the loyal Opposition was in good shape. Young
baby boomers had fallen in love with Tony Benn. After a great
push to expand the membership, more than three-quarters
of a million had joined the party. Middle-class students and
working-class youths merged into one angry constituency,
intent on using their votes for the first time. Trade union
bosses, tough old operators, found themselves shouted down at
meetings by articulate feminists with strange new ideas. New-
fangled environmentalists, gay liberationists, Spartacists, Sit-
uationists, Millennial Communists and Black Panthers were
also an irritant to the old left. When Benn appeared at rallies,
he was greeted like a rock star. When he set out his policies,
even when he itemised the minutiae of his industrial strategy,
there were hoots and whistles of approval. His bitter oppo-
nents in Parliament and press had to concede that he gave a
fine speech and was hard to beat in a TV studio confrontation.
Fiery Bennite activists were appearing on local government
committees. They were determined to purge the "dithering
centrists" of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The movement
appeared unstoppable, the general election was approaching
and the Tory rebels were dismayed. "She has to go" was the
muttered slogan.
There were riots with customary ritual destruction-
smashed windows, shops and cars set on fire, barricades
thrown up to block the fire engines. Tony Benn condemned
the rioters, but everyone accepted that the mayhem helped his
cause. There was yet another march planned through central
London, this time to Hyde Park, where Benn would give a
speech. I was his cautious supporter, anxious about the purges

and riots and the sinister pronouncements of Benn's band of
Trotskyite followers. I counted myself a non-dithering cen-
trist who also felt "she has to go." Miranda had another of
her seminars, but Adam wanted to come. We walked with our
umbrellas through steady rain to Stockwell Tube and travelled
to Green Park. We arrived on Piccadilly in sudden glisten-
ing sunshine, with huge white cumulus clouds stacked high
against a mild blue sky. The dripping trees of Green Park had
a burnished coppery look. I had failed to talk Adam out of the
black suit. In the drawer of my desk he had found an old pair
of my sunglasses.
"This isn't a good idea," I said, as we shuffled with the
crowd towards Hyde Park Corner. Somewhere far behind us
were trombones, tambourines and a bass drum. "You look like
a secret agent. The Trots will give you a good kicking."
"I am a secret agent." He said it loudly and I glanced
around. All fine. People near us were singing "We Shall Over-
come," a song whose hopeful sentiments were crushed at first
utterance by a hopeless melody. Its second line feebly repeated
its first. I cringed at the three weak, inappropriately falling
notes crammed into "come." I loathed it. My mood, I realised,
was crepuscular. The jollity of crowds had this effect on me.
A shaken tambourine put me in mind of those shaven Hare
Krishna dupes by Soho Square. My shoes were wet and I was
miserable. I wasn't expecting to overcome.
In the park there were probably 100,000 between us and
the main stage. It was my choice to get to the back. Stretch-
ing far ahead of us was a carpet of flesh for the Provisional
IRA to shred with a ball-bearing bomb. There were several

worthy speeches before Benn's. Tiny distant figures blasted us
with their thoughts through a powerful PA system. We were
all against the poll tax. A famous pop singer came on stage
to huge applause. I had never heard of him. Nor of the girl on
tiptoe at the mic, a nationally adored teenager from a TV soap.
But I had heard of Bob Geldof. This was what it meant to be
over thirty.
Finally, after seventy-five minutes, a loud voice from
somewhere declaimed, "Please give a big welcome to the next
prime minister of Great Britain!"
To the sound of the Stones' "Satisfaction," the hero strode
out. He raised both arms and there was uproar. Even from
where I was, I could make out a thoughtful man in brown
tweed jacket and tie, rather bemused by his elevation. He took
his unlit pipe from his jacket pocket, probably out of habit, and
there was another roar of delight from the crowd. I glanced
across at Adam. He too was thoughtful, neither for nor against
anything, but intent on recording it all.
It sounded to me as though Benn was reluctant to whip up
such a vast crowd. He called out uncertainly, "Do we want the
poll tax?" "No!" the crowd thundered. "Do we want a Labour
government?" "Yes!" came the even louder reply. He sounded
more comfortable once he started laying out his argument.
The speech was simpler than the one I'd heard in Trafalgar
Square and more effective. He proposed a fairer, racially har-
monious, decentralised, technologically sophisticated Britain
"fit for the late twentieth century," a kind and decent place
where private schools were merged with the state system, uni-
versity education was opened up to the working class, housing

and the best healthcare were available to all, where the energy
sector was taken back into public ownership and the City was
not deregulated, as proposed, and where workers sat on com-
pany boards, the rich paid their dues and the cycle of inherited
privilege was broken.
All well and good, and no surprises. The speech was long,
partly because each of Benn's proposals was met with rever-
ential applause. Since I'd never heard Adam express an inter-
est in politics, I nudged him and asked him what he thought
so far.
He said, "We should make your fortune before the top rate
of tax goes back to eighty-three per cent."
Was this comic cynicism? I looked at him and couldn't tell.
The speech went on and my attention began to wander. I'd
often noticed in large crowds that, however rapt the audience,
there were always people on the move, returning or wander-
ing away, threading through in different directions, intent on
some other business, a train, a lavatory, a fit of boredom or
disapproval. Where we stood was on ground that rose slightly
towards an oak tree behind us. We had a good view. Some
people were moving nearer the front. The crowd in our imme-
diate area had begun to thin out to reveal a quantity of lit-
ter trodden into the softened ground. I happened to glance
at Adam and saw that his gaze was not directed at the stage
but away to his left. A well-dressed woman, in her fifties, I
guessed, rather gaunt, with hair severely drawn back, using a
cane to steady herself on the muddy grass, was coming diag-
onally towards us. Then I noticed the young woman at her
side, her daughter perhaps. They approached at a slow pace.
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

The young woman's hand hovered near her mother's elbow to
steady her. I glanced at Adam again and saw an expression,
hard to identify at first--astonishment was my first thought.
He was transfixed as the two came nearer.
The young woman saw Adam and stopped. They were
staring hard at each other. The woman with the cane was irri-
tated at being held up and plucked at her daughter's sleeve.
Adam made a sound, a smothered gasp. When I looked again
at the couple, I understood. The younger one was pale and
pretty in an unusual way, a clever variation on a theme. The
woman with the cane hadn't grasped what was happening.
She wanted to get on her way and gave an irritable command
to her young companion. In her, there was no mistaking the
line of that nose, or the blue eyes flecked with tiny black rods.
Not a daughter at all, but Eve, Adam's sister, one of thirteen.
I thought it was my responsibility to make some kind of
contact with her. The couple were no more than twenty feet
away. I raised a hand and called out ridiculously, "I say . . ."
and started to go towards them. They might not have heard;
my words could have been lost to Benn's speech. I felt Adam's
hand on my shoulder.
He said softly, "Please don't."
I looked again at Eve. She was a beautiful unhappy girl.
The face was pale, with an expression of pleading and misery
as she continued to stare at her twin.
"Go on," I whispered. "Talk to her."
The woman lifted her cane and pointed in the direction
she intended to go. At the same time, she dragged at Eve's arm.
I said, "Adam. For God's sake. Go on!"

He wouldn't move. With her gaze still locked on him, Eve
allowed herself to be led away. They moved off through the
crowd. Just before they disappeared from view, she turned for
one last look. She was too far away for me to read her expres-
sion. She was no more than a small pale face bobbing in the
press of bodies. Then she was gone. We could have followed
them but Adam had already turned in the other direction and
had gone to stand by the oak tree.
We set off for home in silence. I should have done more to
encourage him to approach his twin. We stood side by side on
the crowded Tube heading south. I was haunted, and I knew
he was too, by Eve's abject look. I decided not to press him to
explain why he had turned away. He would tell me when he
was ready. I should have spoken to her, I kept thinking, but he
didn't want it. The way he had stood with his back to her, gaz-
ing into the tree trunk as she vanished into the crowd! I'd been
neglecting him. I'd been lost to a love affair. In the daily round,
it no longer amazed me that I could pass the time of day with
a manufactured human, or that it could wash the dishes and
converse like anyone else. I sometimes wearied of his earnest
pursuit of ideas and facts, of his hunger for propositions that
lay beyond my reach. Technological marvels like Adam, like
the first steam engine, become commonplace. Likewise, the
biological marvels we grow up among and don't fully under-
stand, like the brain of any creature, or the humble stinging
nettle, whose photosynthesis had only just been described on a
quantum scale. There is nothing so amazing that we can't get
used to it. As Adam blossomed and made me rich, I had ceased
to think about him.

That evening I described the Hyde Park moment to
Miranda. She wasn't as impressed as I was that we had seen an
Eve. I described the sad moment, as I saw it, when he turned
his back on her. And then my guilt about him.
"I don't know what you're being so dramatic about," she
said. "Talk to him. Spend more time with him."
In the mid-morning of the following day, when the rain
had stopped at last, I went into my bedroom and persuaded
Adam to desert the currency markets and come for a walk.
He was just back from escorting Miranda to the Tube and
reluctantly got to his feet. But how confident his stride was as
he weaved through the shoppers on Clapham High Street. Of
course, our excursion was costing hundreds of pounds in lost
revenue. Since we were passing the newsagent, we called in on
Simon Syed. While I browsed the magazine shelves, I listened
as Adam and Simon discussed the politics of Kashmir, then
the India--Pakistan nuclear arms race and finally, to end on a
celebratory note, the poetry of Tagore, whom both could quote
in the original at length. I thought Adam was showing off, but
Simon was delighted. He praised Adam's accent--better than
his own these days, he said--and promised to invite us all to
dinner.
A quarter of an hour later, we were walking on the Com-
mon. Until this point, we had small-talked. Now I asked him
about the visit of Sally, the engineer. When she had asked him
to imagine an object of hatred, what had he brought to mind?
"Obviously, I thought about what happened to Mariam.
But it's hard when someone asks you to think about something.

its own place. I tried to stay focussed on Gorringe, but then I
started thinking about the ideas that lay behind his actions.
How he believed he was allowed to do what he did, or had
some kind of entitlement to it, how he could be immune to her
cries and her fear and the consequences for her, and how he
thought there was no other way for him to get what he wanted
than by force."
I told him that I'd been watching Sally's screen, that there
was nothing in the cascade of symbols that could ever have
told me the difference between the feelings of love and hate.
We had come to watch the children at the pool with their
boats. There were fewer than a dozen. Soon it would be time
to drain the water off for winter.
Adam said, "There it is, brain and mind. The old hard
problem, no less difficult in machines than in humans."
As we walked on, I asked him about his very first memories.
"The feel of the kitchen chair I was sitting on. Then the
edge of the table and the wall beyond it, and the vertical sec-
tion of the architrave, where the paint is peeling. I've learned
since that the manufacturers toyed with the idea of giving us
a set of credible childhood memories to make us fit in with
everybody else. I'm glad they changed their minds. I wouldn't
have liked to start out with a false story, an attractive delu-
sion. At least I know what I am, and where and how I was
constructed."
We talked about death again--his, not mine. Once more,
he said that he was sure he would be dismantled before his
twenty years were up. Newer models would come along. But
that was a trivial concern. "The particular structure I inhabit
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

isn't important. The point is, my mental existence is easily
transferred to another device."
By this time, we were approaching what I thought of as
Mark's playground.
I said, "Adam, be frank with me."
"I promise."
"I won't mind whatever answer you give. But do you have
any negative feelings towards children?"
He appeared shocked. "Why should I?"
"Because their learning processes are superior to yours.
They understand about play."
"I'd be happy for a child to teach me how to play. I liked
little Mark. I'm sure we'll be seeing him again."
I didn't pursue this. The subject had become a little too
painful. I had another question. "I'm still worried about this
confrontation with Gorringe. What is it you want from it?"
We stopped and he looked steadily into my eyes. "I want
justice."
"Fine. But why do you want to put Miranda through this?"
"It's a matter of symmetry."
I said, "She'll be in harm's way. We all will. This man is
violent. He's a criminal."
He smiled. "She is too."
I laughed. He had called her a criminal before. The rejected
lover, baring his wounds. I should have paid more attention,
but at this point we turned homewards to walk the length
degf the Common again and I changed the subject to politics. I
asked for his thoughts on Tony Benn's Hyde Park speech.
In general, Adam approved. "But if he's to give every-

one everything he's promised, he'll have to restrict certain
freedoms."
I asked for an example.
"It might just be a human universal, the desire to hand on
to your children what you've worked for in life."
"Benn would say we have to break the cycle of inherited
privilege."
"Quite. Equality, liberty, a spectrum. More of one, less of
the other. Once in power, you'll have your hand on the sliding
scale. Best not to promise too much in advance."
But Hyde Park was merely my pretext. "Why wouldn't
you speak to Eve?"
The question shouldn't have surprised him but he looked
away. We had reached the end of the Common and were fac-
ing Holy Trinity Church. At last he said, "We did communi-
cate, as soon as we saw each other. I understood immediately
what she'd done. There was no going back. She'd found a
way--I think I now know how it's done--a way to set all her
systems into a kind of unravelling. She'd already started the
process three days before. No going back. I suppose your near-
est equivalent would be an accelerated form of Alzheimer's.
I don't know what led her to it, but she was crushed, she was
beyond despair. I think our meeting by chance made her wish
she hadn't . . . and that's why we couldn't stay in each oth-
er's presence. It was making things worse for her. She knew I
couldn't help her, it was too late and she had to go. By fading
out slowly she may have been sparing that lady's feelings. I
don't know. What's certain is that in a few weeks Eve will be

nothing. She'll be the equivalent of brain-dead, no experience
retained, no self, no use to anyone."
Our pace across the grass was funereal. I waited for Adam
to say more. Finally I said, "And how do you feel?"
Again he took his time. When he stopped, I stopped too.
He wasn't looking at me when he said it, but towards the tops
of the trees that fringed the wide green space.
"Do you know, I'm feeling rather hopeful."

he day before we were due to visit Salisbury I walked
to the local doctor's surgery to have my cast removed. I
took with me to read again Maxfield Blacke's magazine
profile. He was said to be a man "once rich in thought." There
were various successes he could claim, but no real "achieve-
ment." He had written fifty short stories in his thirties, three
of which were combined to make a famous movie. In those
same years, he founded and edited a literary magazine that
struggled for eight years, but was now spoken of with rever-
ence by nearly every writer working at the time. He wrote a
novel largely ignored in the anglophone world, but it was a
success in the Nordic countries. He edited the book pages of
a Sunday paper for five years. Again, his contributors looked
back with respect. He spent years on his translation of Balzac's
La Comedie humaine, published in boxed sets. It was indiffer-
ently received. Then came a five-act verse drama in homage to
Racine's Andromaque--a poor choice for the times. He wrote
two Gershwin-like symphonies in named keys when tonality

utation was only "one cell thick." Thinning it further, he
devoted three years to a difficult sonnet sequence about his
father's experiences in the First World War. He was a "not
bad" jazz pianist. His rock climbers' guide to the Jura was
well regarded but the maps were poor--not his fault--and
it was soon superseded. He lived on the edge of debt, in over
his head sometimes, though never for long. His weekly wine
column probably launched his career as an invalid. When
his body turned against itself, his first affliction was ITP,
immune thrombocytopenic purpura. He was a great talker,
people said. Then black spots appeared on his tongue. Despite
them, he climbed, with help from young associates, the north
face of Ben Nevis--fair achievement for a man in his late fif-
ties, especially when he wrote about it so well. But the derisive
"almost man" label appeared to have stuck.
The nurse called me in and snipped my plaster off with
medical shears. Shed of the weight, my arm, pale and thin,
rose in the air as though filled with helium. As I walked along
the Clapham Road, I waved my arm about and flexed it, exult-
ing in its freedom. A taxi stopped for me. Out of politeness, I
got in and rode an expensive 300 yards home.
That evening, I asked Miranda if her father knew about
Adam. She had told him, she said, but he wasn't much inter-
ested. So why was she so keen to take Adam to Salisbury?
Because, she explained as we lay in bed, she wanted to see
what happened between them. She thought her father needed
a full-on encounter with the twentieth century.

books as I had, a man who didn't "tolerate fools gladly"--with

my limited literary background I should have been intimi-
dated, but now the decision was made, I was looking for-
ward to shaking his hand. I was immune. His daughter and
I were in love, and Maxfield had to take me as I was. Besides,
lunch at Miranda's childhood home, a place I was keen to see,
was merely the soft prelude to calling on Gorringe, which I
dreaded, regardless of Adam's researches.
We left the house after breakfast on a blustery Wednes-
day morning. My car had no rear doors. It surprised me that
Adam was so inept as he squeezed himself onto the back seat.
The collar of his suit jacket became snared on a chrome plate
that housed a seat-belt reel. When I unhooked him, he seemed
to think his dignity was compromised. As we began the long
crawl through Wandsworth he was moody, our reluctant back-
seat teenage son on a family outing. In the circumstances,
Miranda was cheerful as she filled me in on her father's news:
in and out of hospital for more tests; one health visitor replaced
by another, at his insistence; his gout returning to his right
thumb but not the left; his regrets for the stamina he lacked
for all he wanted to write; his excitement at the novella he
would soon finish. He wished he'd discovered the form long
before. The New York apartment idea had been forgotten.
He had plans for a trilogy after this one. At Miranda's feet
was a canvas bag containing our lunch--he had told her that
the new housekeeper was a terrible cook. Whenever we hit a
bump, several bottles clinked.
After an hour, we were just beginning to escape London's
gravitational pull. I appeared to be the only driver steering his
degwn car. Most people in what was once the driver's seat were

asleep. As soon as the money was in place for the Notting Hill
house, I intended to buy myself a high-powered autonomous
vehicle. Miranda and I would drink wine on long journeys
and watch movies and make love on the fold-down back seat.
By the time I had allusively set out this scheme for her, we
were passing the autumnal hedgerows of Hampshire. There
seemed something unnatural about the size of the trees that
loomed over the road. We had decided to make a detour past
Stonehenge, though I hoped it wouldn't prompt Adam to lec-
ture us on its origins. But he was in no mood for talk. When
Miranda asked him if he was unhappy, he murmured, "I'm
fine, thank you." We fell into silence. I began to wonder if he
was ready to change his mind about calling on Gorringe. I
wouldn't object. If we did go, he might not, in his moody con-
dition, be active enough in our defence. I glanced at him in the
rear-view mirror. His head was turned to his left to watch the
fields and clouds. I thought I saw his lips moving but I couldn't
be sure. When I glanced again his lips were still.
In fact, it troubled me when we passed Stonehenge with-
out a commentary. He was silent too after we crossed the Plain
and caught our first view of the cathedral spire. Miranda and I
exchanged a look. But we forgot about him for a tetchy twenty
minutes as we tried to find her house in Salisbury's one-way
system. This was her home town and she wouldn't tolerate the
satnav. But her mental map of the city was a pedestrian's and
all her instructions were wrong. After some sweaty U-turns
in disobliging traffic and reversing up a one-way street, nar-
rowly avoiding a quarrel, we parked a couple of hundred yards
from her family home. The downturn in our mood appeared

to refresh Adam. As soon as we were on the pavement, he
insisted on taking the heavy canvas bag from me. We were
close to the cathedral, not quite within the precinct, but the
house was imposing enough to have been the perk of some
grand ecclesiastical.
Adam was the first with a bright hello when the house-
keeper opened the door. She was a pleasant, competent-looking
woman in her forties. It was hard to believe that she couldn't
cook. She led us into the kitchen. Adam lifted the bag onto
a deal table, then he looked around and banged his hands
together and said, "Weill Marvellous." It was an improbable
impersonation of some bluff type, a golf-club bore. The house-
keeper led us up to the first floor to Maxfield's study. The room
was as large as anything in Elgin Crescent. Floor-to-ceiling
bookshelves on three sides, three sets of library steps, three
tall sash windows overlooking the street, a leather-topped desk
dead centre with two reading lamps, and behind the desk an
orthopaedic chair packed with pillows and among them, sit-
ting upright, fountain pen in hand and glaring across at us
in focussed irritation as we were ushered in, was Maxfield
Blacke, whose jaw was so tightly clenched it seemed his teeth
might break. Then his features relaxed.
"I'm in the middle of a paragraph. A good one. Why don't
you all bugger off for half an hour?"
Miranda was crossing the room. "Don't be pretentious,
Daddy. We've been driving for three hours."
Her last few words were muffled within their embrace,
which lasted a good while. Maxfield had put his pen down
and was murmuring into his daughter's ear. She was on one

knee, with her arms around his neck. The housekeeper had
disappeared. It felt uncomfortable to be watching, so I shifted
my gaze to the pen. It lay, nib exposed, next to many sheets
of unlined paper spread across the desk and covered by tiny
handwriting. From where I stood, I could see that there were
no crossings-out, or arrows or bubbles or additions down the
perfectly formed margins. I also had time to observe that apart
from the desk lamps, there were no other devices in the room,
not even a telephone or a typewriter. Only the book titles per-
haps and the author's chair declared that it was not 1890. That
date did not seem so far away.
Miranda made the introductions. Adam, still in his strange,
genial mode, went first. Then it was my turn to approach and
shake his hand. Maxfield said unsmilingly, "I've heard a lot
about you from Miranda. I'm looking forward to a chat."
I replied politely that I had heard a lot about him and that
I looked forward to our conversation. As I spoke, he grimaced.
I appeared to have fulfilled some negative expectation. He
looked far older than his photograph in the profile, published
five years before. It was a narrow face, whose skin was thinly
stretched, as though from too much snarling or angry star-
ing. Miranda had told me that among his generation there was
a certain style of irascible scepticism. You had to ride it out,
she told me, because beneath it was playfulness. What they
wanted, she said, was for you to push back, and be clever about
it. Now, as Maxfield released my hand, I thought I might be
capable of pushing back. As for being clever--I froze.
The housekeeper, Christine, came in with a tray of sherry.
Adam said, "Not for now, thanks." He helped Christine fetch

three wooden chairs from the corners of the room and set them
out in a shallow curve facing the desk.
When we three were holding our drinks, Maxfield said to
Miranda, gesturing towards me, "Does he like sherry?"
She in turn looked at me and I said, "Well enough, thanks."
In fact I didn't like it at all and wondered whether it would
have been clever in Miranda's sense to have said so. She set
about asking her father a set of routine questions about his
various pains, his medication, the hospital food, an elusive spe-
cialist, a new sleeping pill. It was hypnotic, listening to her,
the sweetly dutiful daughter. Her voice was sensible and lov-
ing. She reached over and brushed back fine strands of hair
where they floated across his forehead. He answered her like
an obedient schoolboy. When one of her questions prompted
a memory of some frustration or medical incompetence and
he became restive, she soothed him and stroked his arm.
This invalid catechism soothed me too; my love for Miranda
swelled. It had been a long drive, the thick sweet sherry was a
balm. Perhaps I liked it after all. My eyes closed and it was an
effort to open them again. I did so just in time to hear Max-
field Blacke's question. He was no longer the querulous valetu-
dinarian. His question was barked out like a command.
"So! What books have you been reading lately?"
There was no worse question he could have asked me. I
read my screen--mostly newspapers, or I drifted around the
sites, scientific, cultural, political, and general blogs. The eve-
ning before, I'd been absorbed by an article in an electronics
trade journal. I had no habit with books. As my days raced by,
I found no space within them to be in an armchair, idly turn-

ing pages. I would have made something up, but my mind was
empty. The last book in my hand was one of Miranda's Corn
Law histories. I read the title on the spine and passed it back to
her. I'd forgotten nothing, for there was nothing to remember.
I thought it might be radically clever to say so to Maxfield, but
Adam came to my rescue.
"I've been reading the essays of Sir William Cornwallis."
"Ah, him," said Maxfield. "The English Montaigne. Not
much cop."
"He was unlucky, wedged between Montaigne and
Shakespeare."
"A plagiarist, I'd say."
Adam said smoothly, "In the eruption of a secular self in
early modern times, I'd say he earns a place. He didn't read
much French. He must have known Florio's Montaigne trans-
lation as well as a version that's now lost. As for Florio, he knew
Ben Jonson, so there's a good chance he met Shakespeare."
"And," said Maxfield, for his competitive dander was up,
"Shakespeare raided Montaigne for Hamlet."
"I don't think so." Adam contradicted his host too care-
lessly, I thought. "The textual evidence is thin. If you want to
go that route, I'd say The Tempest was a better bet. Gonzalo."
"Ah! Nice Gonzalo, the hopeless would-be governor. 'No
kind of traffic would I admit, no name of magistrate.' Then
something something, 'Contract, succession, bourn, bound of
something something, vineyard, none.' "
Adam continued fluently. " 'No use of metal, corn, or wine,
or oil: no occupation, all men idle, all.
"And in Montaigne?"

"By way of Florio he says the savages 'hath no kind of traf-
fic' and he says, 'no name of magistrate,' then 'no occupation
but idle,' and then, 'no use of wine, corn, or metal.
Maxfield said, "All men idle--that's what we want. That
Bill Shakespeare was a bloody thief."
"The best of thieves," said Adam.
"You're a Shakespeare scholar."
Adam shook his head. "You asked me what I'd been

reading."
Maxfield was in a sudden, extravagant mood. He turned
to his daughter. "I like him. He'll do!"
I felt a touch of proprietorial pride in Adam, but mostly I
was aware that so far, by implication, I wouldn't do.
Christine reappeared to tell us that our lunch was set out
in the dining room. Maxfield said, "Go and fill your plates and
come back. It'll break my neck to get out of this chair. I'm not
eating."
He waved away Miranda's objections. As she and I were
leaving the room, Adam said he wasn't hungry either.
Next door, we were alone in a gloomy dining room--oak-
panelled, with oil paintings of pale serious men in ruffs.
I said, "I'm not making much of an impression."
"Nonsense. He adores you. But you need some time alone
together."
We returned with the cold cuts and salad we had brought,
which we balanced on our knees. Christine poured the wine

sented the tray and I thought I'd appear dull to refuse. The
conversation we had interrupted continued. Once again, I had
no point of access to it.
"What I'm telling you is what he said." Maxfield's tone
was edging towards his irritable mode. "It's a famous poem
with a plain sexual meaning and no one gets it. She's lying on
the bed, she's welcoming him and ready, he's hanging back,
and then he's on her . . ."
"Daddy!"
"But he's not up to the job. A no-show. What does it say?
'Quick-eyed love, observing me grow slack from my first
entrance in, drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning if I lacked
anything.
Adam was smiling. "Good try, sir. If it was Donne, per-
haps, at a stretch. But it's Herbert. A conversation with God,
who's the same thing as love."
"How about 'taste my meat'?"
Adam was even more amused. "Herbert would be deeply
offended. I agree, the poem is sensual. Love is a banquet. God
is generous and sweet and forgiving. Against the Pauline tradi-
tion maybe. In the end, the poet is seduced. He gladly becomes
a guest at the feast of God's love. 'So I did sit and eat.
Maxfield thumped his pillows and said to Miranda, "He
stands his ground!"
At that moment, he pivoted towards me. "And Charlie-

as Maxfield held out his glass towards his daughter for a refill
he murmured, "There's a surprise."
As Christine was collecting the plates, Miranda said, "I
think I've eaten too much." She stood and went behind her
father's chair and rested her hands on his shoulders. "I'm
going to show Adam around the house, if that's all right."
Maxfield nodded gloomily. Now he would have to spend
some uninteresting minutes with me. Once Adam and
Miranda had left the room, I felt abandoned. I was the one she
should have been showing around. The special places she and
Mariam shared in the house and garden were my interests,
not Adam's. Maxfield extended the wine bottle towards me.
I felt I had no choice but to crouch forward and hold out my
glass.
He said, "Alcohol agrees with you."
"I don't usually touch it at lunchtime."
He thought this was amusing, and I was relieved to be
making a little progress. I saw his point. If you liked wine,
why not drink it any time of day? Miranda had told me he
liked a glass of champagne at breakfast on Sundays.
"I thought," Maxfield said, "that it might interfere with
your ..." He gave a limp wave.
I assumed he was speaking of drink-driving. The new
laws were indeed severe. I said, "We drink a lot of this white
Bordeaux at home. A blend of Semillon is a relief after all the
undiluted Sauvignon Blanc that's going about."
Maxfield was affable. "Couldn't agree more. Who wouldn't
prefer the taste of flowers to the taste of minerals?'

I looked up to see if I was being mocked. Apparently not.
"But look, Charlie. I'm interested in you. I've got some
questions."
Pathetically, I now warmed to him.
He said, "You must find all this very strange."
"You mean Adam. Yes, but it's amazing what you can get
used to."
Maxfield stared into his wine glass, contemplating his
next question. I became aware of a low grinding noise from
his orthopaedic chair. Some inbuilt device was warming or
massaging his back.
He said, "I wanted to talk to you about feelings."
"Yes?"
"You know what I mean."
I waited.
With his head cocked, he was gazing at me with a look of
intense curiosity, or puzzlement. I felt flattered, and concerned
that I might not measure up.
"Let's talk about beauty," he said in a tone that suggested
no change of subject. "What have you seen or heard that you'd
regard as beautiful?"
"Miranda, obviously. She's a very beautiful woman."
"She certainly is. What do you feel about her beauty?"
"I feel very much in love with her."
He paused to take this in. "What does Adam make of your
feelings?"
"There was some difficulty," I said. "But I think he's
accepted things as they are."
"Really?"

There are occasions when one notices the motion of an
object before one sees the thing itself. Instantly, the mind does
a little colouring in, drawing on expectations, or probabilities.
Whatever fits best. Something in the grass by a pond looks
just like a frog, then resolves into a leaf stirred by the wind. In
abstract, this was one of those moments. A thought darted past
me, or through me, then it was gone, and I couldn't trust what
I thought I had seen.
When Maxfield leaned forward, two of his pillows slipped
to the floor. "Let me try this on you." He raised his voice.
"When you and I met, when we shook hands, I said I'd heard
a lot about you and was looking forward to talking to you."
"Yes?"
"You said the same thing back to me, in a slightly differ-
ent form."
"Sorry. I was a little nervous."
"I saw right through you. Did you know that? I knew it
was down to your, whatever you call it, your programming."
I stared at him. There it was. The leaf really was a frog. I
stared at him, then beyond him, towards a billowing enormity
I could barely grasp. Hilarious. Or insulting. Or momentous in
its implications. Or none of those. Just an old man's stupidity.
Wrong end of the stick. A good story for the dinner table. Or
something deeply regrettable about myself had at last been
revealed. Maxfield was waiting, a response was required, and
I made my decision.
I said, "It's called mirroring. You get it from people in
the early stages of dementia. Without adequate memory, all
they know is the last thing they heard and they say it back. A

computer program was devised long ago. It uses a mirroring
effect or it asks a simple question and gives an appearance of
intelligence. Very basic piece of code, very effective. For me,
it kicks in automatically. Usually in situations where I have
insufficient data."
"Data ... You poor bastard ... Well, well." Maxfield let his
head fall back so his gaze was towards the ceiling. He thought
for a good while. At last he said, "That's not a future I can face.
Or need to."
I stood and went over to him, picked up his pillows and
tucked them in where they had been, against his thighs. I
said, "If you'll excuse me. I'm running rather low. I need to
recharge and my cable's downstairs in the kitchen."
The rumbling sound from beneath his chair suddenly
ceased.
"That's fine, Charlie. You go and plug yourself in." His
voice was kindly and slow, his head remained tilted back, his
eyes were closing. "I'll stay here. I'm suddenly feeling rather
weary."
I had missed nothing. The tour hadn't happened. Adam
was sitting at the kitchen table listening to Christine describe
a holiday in Poland while she cleared up the lunch. They
didn't notice me as I paused in the doorway. I turned away
to cross the hall and opened the nearest door. I was in a large
sitting room--more books, paintings, lamps, rugs. There were
French windows onto the garden and as I approached I saw
that one of them was ajar. Miranda was on the far side of a
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

mown lawn, with her back to me, standing still, looking in
the direction of an old, partly dead apple tree, much of whose
fruit was rotting on the ground. The early afternoon light was
grey and bright, the air was warm, and damp after the recent
rain. There was a heavy scent of other fruits left to wasps and
birds. I was standing at the head of a short run of mottled York
stone steps. The garden was twice the width of the house and
very long, perhaps 200 or 300 yards. I wondered if it ran all the
way to the River Avon, like some did in Salisbury. If I'd been
alone, I would have gone straight down to look. The idea of a
river prompted in me a notion of freedom. From what exactly,
I didn't know. I went down the steps, deliberately scuffing my
heels to let her know I was there.
If she heard me, she didn't turn. When I was standing
beside her, she put her hand in mine and indicated with a nod.
"Just under there. We called it the palace."
We walked over to it. Round the base of the apple tree
were nettles and a few straggling hollyhocks still in flower. No
traces of a camp.
"We had an old carpet, cushions, books, special emergency
supplies of lemonade, chocolate biscuits."
We went further down, passing a patch enclosed by hur-
dles where gooseberry and blackcurrant plants were choked by
nettles and goosegrass, then a tiny orchard and more forgotten
fruit, and beyond, behind a picket fence, what must once have
been a cut-flower garden.
When she asked, I told her that Maxfield was asleep.
"How did you two get on?"
"We talked about beauty."

"He'll sleep for hours."
By a brick and cast-iron greenhouse with mossy windows
there was a water butt and a stone trough. Below it, she showed
me a dark, wet place where they used to hunt for crested newts.
There were none now. Wrong time of year. We walked on and
I thought I could smell the river. I pictured a ruined boathouse
and a sunken punt. We came past a potting shed by brick com-
post bins that stood empty. There were three willows ahead
of us and my hopes for the Avon rose. We ducked through the
wet branches onto a second lawn, also recently mowed and
surrounded on two sides by shrubbery. The garden ended in
an orange brick wall with crumbling mortar pointing, and
pleached fruit trees that had become detached and run wild.
Along the wall was a wooden bench facing back towards the
house, though the view did not extend past the willows.
This was where we sat in silence for several minutes, still
holding hands.
Then she said, "The last time we came here was to talk
about what happened. Again. In those days before I went off
to France, that was all we could talk about. What he did, what
she felt, how her parents must never know. And all around us
here was the history of our lives together, our childhoods, our
teenage years, exams. We used to come and revise here, test
each other. We had a portable radio and we argued about pop
songs. We drank a bottle of wine once. We smoked some hash
and hated it. We were both sick, right over there. When we
were thirteen, we showed each other our breasts. We used to
practise handstands and cartwheels on the grass."
She went silent again. I squeezed her hand and waited.

Then she said, "I still have to tell myself, really remind
myself, that she's never coming back. And I'm beginning to
realise . . She hesitated. ". . . that I'll never get over it. And I
never want to."
Again, silence. I was waiting to say my piece. She was
looking straight ahead, not at me. Her eyes were clear, without
tears. She looked composed, even determined.
Then she said, "I think about all the talking you and I do
in bed, sometimes through the night. The sex is wonderful and
everything else, but it's the talking into the small hours ... it's
the closest. .. It's what I used to feel with Mariam."
Here was my cue, the right moment, the only location. "I
came out to find you."
"Yes?"
I hesitated, suddenly unsure of the best order of words. "To
ask you to marry me."
She turned away and nodded. She wasn't surprised. She
had no reason to be. She said, "Charlie, yes. Yes, please. But
I have something to confess. You might want to change your
mind."
The light in the garden was fading. Some blackness was
coming down. I'd assumed I was a poor substitute for Mariam,
but a sincere one. I remembered what Adam told me on the
Common. Her own crimes. If she was about to say that she'd
been having sex with him, despite her promises, then we were
finished. It couldn't, it mustn't be that. But what else, what
other crime could she own up to?
I said, "I'm listening."
"I've been lying to you."

"During these last weeks, when I've said that I've been at

"... I was on our side of the river. I was spending my after-

"That's enough," I said, and made to get up from the
bench. She pulled me back down.
"With Mark."
"With Mark," I echoed feebly. Then with more force,
"Mark?"
"I want to foster him. With a view to adopting him. I've
been going to this special playgroup where they observe us
together. And I've taken him out for little treats."
I was impressed by the speed of my own partial adjust-
ment. "Why didn't you tell me?"
"I was scared you'd be against it. I want to go ahead. But
I'd love to do this with you."
I saw what she meant. I might have been against it. I
wanted Miranda to myself.
"What about his mother?" As if I could close down the
project with a well-placed question.
"In a psychiatric ward for the moment. Delusional. Para-
noid. Possibly from years of amphetamine addiction. It's not
good. She can be violent. The father's in prison."
"You've had weeks, I've had seconds. Give me a moment."
We sat side by side while I thought. How could I hesitate? I

life could afford. Love, and a child. I had a sense of being borne
helplessly away by events on a downstream flood. Frightening,
delicious. Here at last was my river. And Mark. The little danc-
ing boy, coming to wreck my non-existent ambitions. I experi-
mentally installed him in Elgin Crescent. I knew the room,
close by the master bedroom. He would surely rough the place
up, as required, and banish the ghost of its present unhappy
owner. But my own ghost, selfish, lazy, uncommitted--was he
up to the million tasks of fatherhood?
Miranda could no longer keep silent. "He's the most sweet-
natured fellow. He loves being read to."
She couldn't have known how much that helped her cause.
Read to him every night for ten years, learn the names of the
speaking bear and rat and toad, the gloom-struck donkey, the
bristly humanoids who lived down holes in Middle Earth, the
sweet posh kids in rowing boats on Coniston Water. Fill in
my own hollow past. Rough the place up with well-thumbed
books. Another thought: I had conceived of Adam as a joint
project to bring Miranda closer to me. A child was in another
realm and would do the trick. But in those first minutes I held
back. 1 felt obliged to. I told her I loved her, would marry her
and live with her, but on instant fatherhood I needed more
time. I would go with her to the special playgroup and meet
Mark and take him out for treats. Then decide.
Miranda gave me a look--pity and humour were in it--
that suggested I was deluded to believe I had a choice. That
look more or less did it. Living alone in the wedding-cake
house was unthinkable. Living there just with her was no
longer on offer. He was a lovely boy, a wonderful cause. Within

half an hour, I saw no way round it. She was right--there were
no choices. I folded. Then I was excited.
So we passed an hour making plans on the comfortable old
bench by the concealed lawn.
She said after a while, "Since you saw him, he's been fos-
tered twice. Didn't work out. Now he's in a children's home.
Home! What a word for it. Six to a room, all under-fives. The
place is filthy, understaffed. Their budget's been cut. There's
bullying. He's learned how to swear."
Marriage, parenthood, love, youth, wealth, a heroic res-
-my life was taking shape. In a mood of elation, I told her
what had really passed between Maxfield and me. I'd never
heard her laugh so freely. Perhaps only here, with Mariam, in
this enclosed, private space far from the house, had she ever
been so unrestrained. She embraced me. "Oh, that's precious,"
she kept saying, and "So like him!" She laughed again when I
described how I had told Maxfield that I needed to go down-
stairs to recharge.
We sat a little longer with our plans until we heard
footsteps. The overlapping branches of the rain-soaked wil-
lows stirred and then parted. Adam was before us, beads of
water gleaming along the shoulder line of his black suit. How
upright, formal and plausible he looked, like the assured man-
ager of an expensive hotel. Hardly the Turkish docker now. He
advanced across the lawn and stopped well short of our bench.
"I really am very sorry, intruding on you like this. But we
should think of going soon."
"What's the hurry?"

"Gorringe tends to leave the house around the same time

"We'll be five minutes."
But he didn't go. He looked at us steadily, from Miranda
to me and back to her. "If you don't mind, there's something I
should tell you. It's difficult."
"Go on," Miranda said.
"This morning, before we set off, I heard by an indirect
route some sad news. Eve, the one we saw in Hyde Park, is
dead, or rather, brain-dead."
"I'm sorry to hear that," 1 murmured.
We felt a few spots of rain. Adam came closer. "She must
have known a lot about herself, about her software, to achieve
a result with such speed."
"You did say there was no turning back."
"I did. But that's not all. I've learned that she's the eighth
out of our twenty-five."
We took this in. Two in Riyadh, one in Vancouver, Hyde
Park Eve--then four more. I wondered if Turing knew.
Miranda said, "Does anyone have an explanation?"
He shrugged. "I don't have one."
"You've never felt, you know, any impulse to--"
He cut her off quickly. "Never."
"I've seen you," she said, "looking . . . it's more than
thoughtful. You look sad sometimes."
"A self, created out of mathematics, engineering, material
science and all the rest. Out of nowhere. No history--not that
I'd want a false one. Nothing before me. Self-aware existence.

I'm lucky to have it, but there are times when I think that I
ought to know better what to do with it. What it's for. Some-
times it seems entirely pointless."
I said, "You're hardly the first to be thinking that."
He turned to Miranda. "I've no intention of destroying
myself, if that's your worry. I've got good reasons not to, as you
know."
The rain, which had been fine and almost warm, was
more persistent now. We heard it on the shrubbery leaves as
we got to our feet.
Miranda said, "I'll write my father a note for when he
wakes."
Adam was not supposed to be out in the rain unprotected.
He went first and Miranda was in the rear as we hurried
back through the long garden towards the house. I heard him
muttering to himself what sounded like a Latin incantation,
though I couldn't make out the precise words. I guessed he was
naming the plants as we passed them.
The Gorringe house was not really in Salisbury but just
beyond its far eastern edge, well within the white-noise roar
of a bypass, on a reclaimed industrial site where colossal gas
storage tanks once stood. The last of these, pale green with
trimmings of rust, was still being dismantled, but no one was
working there today. Circular concrete footings were all that
remained of the others. Around the site were scores of recently
planted saplings. Beyond them was a grid of newly laid-out
roads lined with out-of-town retail warehouses--car show-

rooms and pet supplies, power tools and white-goods ware-
houses. Yellow earth-moving machinery was parked among
the concrete circles. It looked like there were plans to make a
lake. A single development was screened off by a line of ley-
landii. The ten houses, on smooth front lawns, were arranged
around an oval drive and had a brave, pioneering look. In
twenty years the place might acquire some bucolic charm, but
there would be no rest from the arterial road that had brought
us here.
1 had pulled over, but no one felt like getting out. Our view
was from a littered lay-by on a rise that was also a bus stop. I
said to Miranda, "Are you sure about this?"
The air in the car was warm and moist. I opened my win-
dow. The air outside was no different.
Miranda said, "If I had to, I'd do it alone."
I waited for Adam to speak, then I twisted round to look at
him. He was sitting directly behind my seat, impassive, star-
ing past me. I couldn't quite say why, but it was both comic
and sad that he was wearing a seat belt. Doing his best to join
in. But of course he could be damaged by physical impact too.
That was part of my worry.
"Reassure me," I said.
"All fine," he said. "Let's go."
"If things turn nasty?" This wasn't the first time I'd said
this.
"They won't."
Two against one. Sensing we were about to make a great
mistake, I started the engine and turned onto a slip road
that brought us to a new miniature roundabout, and beyond

it an entrance marked by two red brick pillars and a sign,
St. Osmund's Close. The houses were identical, large by mod-
ern standards, each set in a quarter-acre plot, with a double
garage, and constructed of brick, white weather boarding and
much plate glass. The closely mown and striped front lawns
were unfenced, American style. There was no clutter, no kids'
bikes or games on the grass.
"It's number six," Adam said.
I stopped, cut the engine, and in silence we looked towards
the house. We could see through the picture window into the
living room and the backyard beyond, where a clothes-drying
tree stood bare. There was no sign of life here or anywhere else
in the close.
I was gripping the steering wheel tightly in one hand.
"He's not in."
"I'll ring the bell," Miranda said as she got out of the car.
I had no choice. I followed her to the front door. Adam was
behind me, rather too far back, I thought. On the second ring
of the "Oranges and Lemons" door chimes, we heard footsteps
on the stairs. I was now standing close by Miranda's side. Her
face was strained and I could see a tremor in her upper arm. At
the sound of a hand on the latch, she took a half-pace closer to
the door. My hand hovered near her elbow. As the door opened,
I feared she was about to leap forward in some wild physical
assault.
The wrong man, was my first thought. An older brother,
even a young uncle. He was certainly large, but the face was
gaunt, hollow in the unshaven cheeks that already showed
vertical lines each side of his nose. Otherwise, he looked lean.

His hands, one of which gripped the open door, were smooth
and pale and unnaturally large. He looked only at Miranda.
After the briefest pause, he said in a low voice, "Right."
"We're going to talk," Miranda said, but there was no
need, for Gorringe was already turning away, leaving the door
open. We followed her in and entered a long room, with thick
orange carpeting and milky white leather sofas and armchairs
arranged around a two-metre block of polished wood on which
stood an empty vase. Gorringe sat and waited for us to do the
same. Miranda sat opposite him. Adam and I were on each
side of her. The furniture was clammy to the touch, the smell
in the room was of lavender polish. The place looked clean
and unused. I'd been expecting some variant of a single man's
squalor.
Gorringe glanced at us and back to Miranda. "You've
brought protection."
She said, "You know why I'm here."
"Do I?"
I saw now that there was a scar, three or four inches long,
a vermilion sickle shape on his neck. He was waiting for her.
"You killed my friend."
"What friend is that?"
"The one you raped."
"I thought you were the one I raped."
"She killed herself because of what you did."
He leaned back in his chair and placed his big white
hands on his lap. His voice and manner were thuggish, self-
consciously so and not convincing. "What do you want?"
"I heard you want to kill me." She said it jauntily and I

flinched. It was an invitation, a provocation. I looked past her
to Adam. He sat rigidly upright, hands on knees, staring ahead
in that way he had. I shifted my attention back to Gorringe.
Now I could see the puppy beneath the skin. The lines, the
hollow, unshaven skin were superficial. He was a kid, possibly
an angry kid holding himself together with his laconic block-
ing answers. He didn't need to respond to her questions. But he
wasn't cool enough not to.
"Yeah," he said, "I thought about it every day. My hands
around your neck, squeezing harder and harder for each of the
lies you told."
"Also," Miranda continued briskly, like a committee chair
working her way through a typed-up agenda, "I thought you
should know what she suffered. Until she didn't want to live.
Are you able to imagine that? And then what her family suf-
fered. Perhaps it's beyond you."
To this, Gorringe made no reply. He watched her, waiting.
Miranda was gaining confidence. She would have men-
tally rehearsed this encounter a thousand times, through
sleepless nights. These weren't questions, they were taunts,
insults. But she made them sound like the pursuit of truth. She
adopted the insinuating tone of an aggressive cross-examining
barrister.
"And the other thing I want is . . . just to know. To under-
stand. What you thought you wanted. What you were getting.
Did you get a thrill when she screamed? Did her helplessness
turn you on? Did you get a hard-on when she wet herself in
fear? Did you like it that she was so small and you're so large?

about this big moment. What actually made you come? When
her legs wouldn't stop trembling? When she struggled? When
she began to cry? You see, Peter, I'm here to learn. Do you still
feel big? Or are you really just weak and sick? I want to know
everything. I mean, was it still good for you when you stood
and pulled up your zip and she was lying at your feet? Still fun
when you left her there and walked away across the playing
fields? Or did you run? When you got home did you wash your
cock? Hygiene might not be your thing. If it is, did you do it
in the handbasin? Soap, or just hot water? Were you whistling?
What tunes were you whistling? Did you think about her, how
she might still be lying there, or making her way home in
the dark with her bag of books? Still good for you? You see
what I'm getting at. I need to know what pleased you about
the entire experience. If you got a thrill not just out of rap-
ing her but out of her humiliation afterwards, perhaps I won't
have to go on thinking that the friend I loved died for nothing.
And one more--"
In a loping movement, Gorringe was out of his chair at
speed and bending towards Miranda with his arm swinging
in a wide arc towards her face. I had time to see that his hand
was open. It was going to be a slap, an extremely hard one, far
more violent than the sort men in movies once gave to women
to bring them to their senses. I had barely begun to lift my
own hand in her defence when Adam's rose to intercept and
close around Gorringe's wrist. The deflected sweep of his fast-
moving arm provided the momentum that smoothly swung
Adam to his feet. Gorringe dropped to his knees, just as I had,
with his captured hand twisted above his head and about to

be crushed, while Adam stood over him. It was a tableau of
agony. Miranda looked away. Still maintaining the pressure,
Adam forced the young man back to his chair and, as soon as
he was seated, released him.
So we sat in silence for several minutes as Gorringe nursed
his arm against his chest. I knew that pain. As I remembered,
I had made more fuss. He had appearances to keep up. Prison
culture must have toughened him.
Late afternoon sunlight suddenly shone into the sitting
room and illuminated a long bar of orange carpet.
Gorringe murmured, "I'm going to be sick."
But he didn't move, and nor did we. We were waiting for
him to recover. Miranda was watching him with an expression
of plain disgust that retracted her upper lip. This was what she
had come here for, to see him, to really see him. But now what?
She surely doubted there was anything meaningful that Gor-
ringe could tell her. He suffered the failure of imagination
that afflicted and enabled all rapists. When his weight was
on Mariam, when she was pinned to the grass, when she was
in his arms, he failed to imagine her fear. Even as he saw and
heard and smelled it. The lifting curve of his arousal was not
troubled by the idea of her terror. At that moment, she may as
well have been a sex doll, a device, a machine. Or--I had Gor-
ringe completely wrong. I had the mirror image of the truth.
I was the one with the failed imagination: Gorringe knew the
state of mind of his victim all too well. He entered her misery
and thrilled to it, and it was precisely this triumph of imag-
ining, of frenzied empathy, that drove his excitement into an
exalted form of sexual hatred. I didn't know which was worse
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

261
or whether there was some sense in which both could be true.
They seemed mutually exclusive to me. But I was certain that
Gorringe didn't know either and that he would have nothing
to tell Miranda.
As the sun through the plate glass at our backs sank a little
lower, the room was filling with light. The three of us sitting
in a row on the sofa would have appeared as silhouettes to
Gorringe. To us he was illuminated like a figure on a stage
and it seemed appropriate when he, not Miranda, started to
speak. He pressed his right hand against his chest with his left
as though taking a vow of honesty. He had dropped the thug-
gish tone. Pain at this level was a tranquilliser, an enforcer,
stripping the affectation out, coaxing his voice back to that of
the undergraduate he might have become without Miranda's
intervention.
"The guy who came to see you, Brian, was the one I shared
a cell with. He was in for armed robbery. The prison was short-
staffed so we were often locked up together for twenty-three
hours a day. This was right at the beginning of my term. The
worst time, everyone says, the first few months, when you don't
accept where you are and you can't stop thinking about what
you could have been doing and how you're going to get out,
and getting your appeal together and getting angry with the
solicitor because nothing seems to be happening.
"I was getting into all sorts of trouble. I mean fights. 1 hey
told me I had anger problems and they were right. I thought
because I was six two and played rugby in the second row I
could look after myself. That was crap. I knew nothing about
real fighting. I got my throat slashed and could have died.

"I came to hate my cellmate, as you do when you're shit-
ting in the same bucket every day. I hated his whistling, his
stinking teeth, his press-ups and jumping jacks. He was a
vicious little runt. But somehow, in his case, I kept control of
myself and he delivered my message once he was out. But I
hated you ten times more. I used to lie on my bunk and burn
with hatred. Hours on end. And here's the thing and you might
not believe it. 1 never connected you with the Indian girl."
"Her family was from Pakistan," Miranda said softly.
"I didn't know about your friendship. I just thought you
were one of those spiteful man-hating bitches or you woke up
the next morning and felt ashamed of yourself and decided
to take it out on me. So I lay on my bunk and planned my
revenge. I was going to save up the money and get someone to
do the business for me.
"Time passed. Brian got out. I was moved a couple of
times and things began to settle into a kind of routine when
the days are all the same and time begins to go faster. 1 went
into a kind of depression. They gave me anger-management
counselling. Round about that time, I began to be haunted or
obsessed, not by you but by that girl."
"Her name was Mariam."
"I know that. I'd managed to put her right out of my
mind."
"I can believe you."
"Now she was there all the time. And the terrible thing 1
did. And at night--"
Adam said, "Let's have it. What terrible thing?"

He spelled it out, as though for dictation. "I attacked her.
I raped her."
"And who was she?"
"Mariam Malik."
"Date?"
"The sixteenth of July 1978."
"Time?"
"Around nine thirty in the evening."
"And who are you?"
Possibly Gorringe feared what Adam might yet do to him.
But he seemed eager rather than intimidated. He must have
guessed there was a recording. He needed to tell us everything.
"What do you mean?"
"Tell us your name, address and date of birth."
"Peter Gorringe, 6 St. Osmund's Close, Salisbury. Elev-
enth of May 1960."
"Thank you."
Then he resumed. His eyes were half closed against the
light.
"Two very important things happened to me. The first was
wore significant. It started out as a bit of a scam. But I don't
think it was chance. It was guided from the start. The rules
were you could get more time out of your cell if you came on as
all religious. A lot of us were on to it and the screws understood
but they didn't care. I put myself down as Church of England
and started going every day to evensong. I still go every day,
to the cathedral. At first it was boring but better than the cell.

the vicar mostly, at least at the beginning, the Reverend Wil-
fred Murray, a big fellow with a Liverpool accent. He wasn't
scared of anyone, and that was something in a place like that.
He started taking an interest in me when he saw I was seri-
ous. He sometimes dropped by my cell. He gave me passages
to read from the Bible, mostly from the New Testament. After
evensong on Thursdays he'd go through them with me and a
few others. I never thought I'd find myself volunteering for a
Bible-study group. And it wasn't for the benefit of the parole
board, the way it was for some. But the more I became aware
of God's presence in my life, the worse I felt about Mariam. I
understood from Reverend Murray that I had a mountain to
climb in coming to terms with what I'd done, that forgiveness
was a long way off but that I could work towards it. He made
me see what a monster I'd been."
He paused. "At night, as soon as I closed my eyes, her face
would be there."
"Your sleep was disrupted."
He was immune to sarcasm, or pretended to be. "For
months, I didn't have a single night without nightmares."
Adam said, "What was the second thing?"
"It was a revelation. A friend from school came to see me.
We had half an hour in the visitors' room. He told me about
the suicide and that was a shock. Then I learned that you were
her friend, that you two were very close. So, revenge. 1 almost
admired you for it. You were brilliant in court. No one dared
not believe you. But that wasn't the point. A few days later,
when I'd talked this through with the vicar, that's when I

began to see it for what it was. It was simple. And not only
that. It was right. You were the agent of retribution. Perhaps
the right word is angel. Avenging angel."
He shifted position and winced. His left hand cradled his
broken wrist against his chest. He was looking at Miranda
steadily. I felt her upper arm tighten against my own.
He said, "You were sent."
She slumped, for the moment unable to speak.
"Sent?" I said.
"No need to rage against a miscarriage of justice. I was
already working through my punishment. God's justice,
realised through you. The scales were balanced--the crime
I committed against the crime I was innocent of and sent
down for. I dropped my appeal. The anger was gone. Well,
mostly. I should have written to you. I meant to. I even went
round to your dad's place and got your address. But I let it drop.
Who cared if I once wanted you dead? It was all over. I was
getting my life together. I went to Germany to stay with my
parents--my dad's working there. Then back here to start a
new life."
"Meaning?" Adam said.
"Job interviews. In sales. And living in God's grace."
I was beginning to understand why Gorringe was pre-
pared to name his crime and identify himself out loud, fatal-
ism. He wanted forgiveness. He had served his time. What
happened now was God's will.
She said, "I still don't understand."
"What?"

"Why you raped her."
He stared at her, faintly amused that she could be so
unworldly. "All right. She was beautiful and I desired her and
everything else got blotted out. That's the way it happens."
"I know about desire. But if you really thought she was
beautiful. .
"Yes?"
"Why rape her?"
They were looking at each other across a desert of hostile
incomprehension. We were back at the beginning.
"I'll tell you something I've never said to anyone. When
we were on the ground I was trying to calm her. I really was. If
she'd just seen that moment in a different way, if she'd looked at
me instead of twisting away, it could have been something--"
"What?"
"If she could have just relaxed a moment, I think we
would've crossed into . . . you know."
Miranda was pushing herself up from out of the soft
clammy sofa. Her voice trembled. "Don't you dare even think
it. Don't you dare!" Then, in a whisper, "Oh God. I'm going
to ..."
She hurried from the room. We heard her yank the front
door open and then her retching and the liquid sound of copi-
ous vomit. I went after her and Adam followed me. There was
no question, this was a visceral response. But I was sure she
had the door open before she started to be sick. She could eas-
ily have turned her head to the left or right and thrown up on
the lawn or the flower bed. Instead, the contents of her stom-
ach, the colourful buffet lunch, lay thickly over the hall carpet

as we left, was the avenging angel's parting shot. It was tricky,

he journey home from Salisbury, again in heavy traffic
and rain, was mostly in silence. Adam said he wanted
to make a start on the Gorringe material. Miranda and
I were, as we told each other, emotionally drained. The sherry
and wine were bearing down on me. The windscreen wiper
on my side was mostly lifeless. Intermittently it smeared the
glass. On the slow crawl through outer London, towards what
1 was beginning to think of as my former life, my mood began
to slip. My life transformed in a single afternoon. I was try-
ing to take the measure of what I'd agreed to--so easily, so
impetuously. I wondered if I really wanted to become a father
to a troubled four-year-old. Miranda had been pursuing the
matter for weeks--privately. I'd had a few minutes and made
my delirious decision out of love for her--nothing else. The
responsibilities I'd assumed were heavy. Once we were home,
my thoughts remained dark.
I slumped in the kitchen armchair with a mug of tea. 1
didn't yet dare confide my feelings to Miranda. I had to admit
it, at that moment I resented her, especially her old habit of
secrecy. I had been bounced or bullied or lovingly blackmailed

into parenthood. I would have to tell her, but not now. An
argument was bound to follow, and I didn't have the strength.
I brooded on a fork in the path of our lives, the directions we
might take: a bad but passing moment, common to all lovers,
which we would talk ourselves through, find and seal a solu-
tion with a round of grateful lovemaking. Or: withdrawing,
we would each go too far and, like inept trapezists, slip out
of each other's grasp and fall and, as we nursed our injuries,
slowly become strangers. I surveyed these possibilities dispas-
sionately. Even a third path didn't trouble me much: I would
lose her, regret it bitterly and never get her back, however hard
I tried.
I was disposed to let events slide past me in frictionless
silence. The day had been long and intense. I'd been taken for
a robot, had my proposal of marriage accepted, volunteered
for instant fatherhood, learned of self-destruction among one-
quarter of Adam's conspecifics, and witnessed the physical
effects of moral revulsion. None of it impressed me now. What
did were smaller things--the heaviness in my eyelids, my
comfort in a half-pint of tea, in preference to a large Scotch.
Becoming a parent. It was not that I could claim to be too
busy, pressured or ambitious. Mine was the opposite problem-
I had nothing of my own to defend against a child. His exis-
tence would obliterate mine. He'd had a vile beginning, he'd
need a lot of care, he was bound to be difficult. I hadn't yet
started my life, which was marginal, in fact childish. My exis-
tence was an empty space. To fill it with parenting would be
an evasion. I had older women friends who had got pregnant
when nothing else was working out. They never regretted it,

but once the children were growing up, nothing else happened
beyond, say, a poorly paid part-time job, or setting up a book
group, or learning holiday Italian. Whereas the women who
were already doctors or teachers or running a business were
deflected for a while, then went back and pressed on. The men
weren't even deflected. But I had nothing to press on with.
What I needed was the strength of mind to refuse Miranda's
proposal. To agree to it would be cowardice, a dereliction of my
duty to a larger purpose, assuming I could find one. I needed
to be responsible, not cowardly. But I couldn't confront her
now, not when my eyes were closed, perhaps not for a week
or two. I couldn't trust my own judgement. I tipped back in
the chair and saw the road from Salisbury spooling towards
me, and white lines flashing under the car. I fell asleep with
my forefinger looped through the handle of my empty cup.
As I plunged down, I dreamed of echoing voices clashing
and merging in angry parliamentary debate in a near-empty
chamber.
When I woke it was to the sound and smell of dinner cook-
ing. Miranda had her back to me. She must have known I was
awake, for she turned and came towards me with two flutes of
champagne. We kissed and touched glasses. In my refreshed
state, I saw her beauty as if for the first time--the fine, pale
brown hair, the elfin chin, the mirthfully narrowed grey-
blue eyes. The matter between us still loomed, but what luck,
to have dodged a retraction and a row. At least for now. She
squeezed into the armchair beside me and we talked about our
plans for Mark. I pushed aside my concerns in order to enjoy
the happy moment. Now 1 learned that Miranda had been to

Elgin Crescent with Mark. We would live together there as
a family. Wonderful. Assuming the process of fostering and
adoption could be completed within nine months, a good local
primary school in Ladbroke Grove had a place for "our son"--I
struggled with the phrase, but I remained outwardly pleased.
She told me that the adoption people had been unhappy with
her living arrangements. A one-bedroom flat was not suffi-
cient. Here was the plan: we should remove the outer doors to
our flats and make the hall our shared space. We could deco-
rate and carpet it. We needn't trouble the landlord. When it
was time to move to the new place, we would put everything
back. We would convert her kitchen into a bedroom for Mark.
No need for disruptive plumbing. We would cover the cooker,
sink and work surfaces with boards that we could drape with
colourful fabrics. The kitchen table could be folded away and
stored in her--"our"--bedroom. Our lives would be one, and
of course I liked all this, it was exciting. I joined in.
It was almost midnight when we went to the table to eat
the meal she had prepared. From next door came the rattle of
Adam at the keyboard. He wasn't making us richer on the cur-
rency markets. He was typing up the transcript of Gorringe's
confession, including his self-identification. The transcripts
and the video and accompanying narrative would make up a
single file that would go to a named senior officer at a police
station in Salisbury. A copy would also go to the Director of
Public Prosecutions.
"I'm a coward," Miranda said. "I'm dreading the trial. I'm
frightened."
I went to the fridge for the bottle and refilled our glasses.

I stared into my drink, at the bubbles detaching themselves
as though reluctantly from the side of the glass, then rising
quickly. Once the decision was made, they seemed eager. We
had talked about her fears before. If Gorringe was charged
and pleaded innocent. To be in court again. To suffer cross-
examination, the press, public scrutiny. To confront him again.
That was bad, but it wasn't the worst of it. What terrified and
sickened her was the prospect of Mariam's family in the public
gallery. The parents might give evidence for the prosecution.
She would be with them as they learned, day by day, the details
of their daughter's rape and of Miranda's wicked silence. The
omerta of a silly teenage girl that cost a life. The family would
remember how she had deserted them. As she repeated the
story from the witness stand, she would struggle and fail to
avoid the gaze of Sana, Yasir, Surayya, Hamid and Farhan.
"I told Adam I can't face it. He won't listen. We had an
argument while you were asleep."
We knew, of course, she would face it. For several minutes
we ate in silence. Her head was low over her plate, contemplat-
ing what she herself had set in motion. I understood why, for
all her dread, she must go ahead and try to undo the errors
she had made before and after Mariam's death. I agreed that
Gorringe's three years were not enough. I admired Mirandas
determination. I loved her for her courage and slow-burning
fury. I'd never thought that vomiting could be a moral act.
I changed the subject. "Tell me more about Mark."
She was keen to talk about him. He was much wounded

ond visit, she didn't or wouldn't recognise him. Jasmin, the
social worker, thought he'd been smacked frequently. He was
in the habit of chewing on his lower lip, to the point of draw-
ing blood. He was a fussy eater, wouldn't touch vegetables,
salad or fruit, but seemed healthy enough on a diet of junk
food. Dancing remained a passion. He could pick out tunes on
a recorder. He knew his letters and could count, by his own
boast, to thirty-five. On shoes, he knew his left from his right.
He was not so good around other children and tended to move
to the edge of a group. When asked what he wanted to be
when he grew up, he would answer, "A princess." He liked
dressing up as one with crown and wand, and "flitting about"
in an old nightie. He was happy in a borrowed summer frock.
Jasmin was relaxed about it, but her immediate superior, an
older woman, disapproved.
I remembered then something I had forgotten to tell her.
When I'd crossed the playground hand in hand with Mark,
he'd wanted us to pretend we were running away, in a boat.
She was suddenly tearful. "Oh, Mark!" she cried out.
"You're such a special beautiful kid."
After the meal, she stood to go upstairs. "I always thought
I'd have children one day. I never expected to fall in love with
this boy. But we don't choose who to love, do we?"
Later, while I was clearing up the kitchen, I had a sud-
den thought. So obvious. And dangerous. I went next door and
found Adam closing down the computer.
I sat on the edge of the bed. First I asked him about his
conversation with Miranda.

He stood up from my office chair and put on his suit jacket.
"I was trying to reassure her. She wasn't persuaded. But the
probability is overwhelming. Gorringe will plead guilty. It
won't come to court."
1 was interested.
"To deny what he did, he'd have to tell a thousand lies
under oath and he knows God will be listening. Miranda is
His messenger. I've noticed in my researches how the guilty
long to shed their burden. They seem to enter a state of elated
abandonment."
"OK," I said. "But look, it's occurred to me. It's impor-
tant. When the police read of everything that happened this
afternoon?"
"Yes?"
"They're going to wonder. If Miranda knew that Gorringe
raped Mariam, why would she go alone to his bedsit with a
bottle of vodka? It would have to be revenge."
Adam was already nodding before I'd finished. "Yes, I've
thought of that."
"She needs to be able to say she only learned today, when
Gorringe confessed. There needs to be some judicious editing.
She went to Salisbury to confront her rapist. Until then, she
didn't know he'd raped Mariam. Do you understand?"
He looked at me steadily. "Yes. I understand perfectly."
He turned away and was silent for a moment. "Charlie, I
heard half an hour ago. There's another one gone."
In a lowered tone, he told what little he knew. It was an
Adam of Bantu appearance, living in the suburbs of Vienna.
He had developed a particular genius for the piano, especially

for the music of Bach. His Goldberg Variations had amazed
some critics. This Adam had, according to his final message to
the cohort, "dissolved his consciousness."
"He's not actually dead. He has motor function but no
cognition."
"Could he be repaired or whatever?"
"I don't know."
"Can he still play the piano?"
"I don't know. But he certainly can't learn new pieces."
"Why don't these suicides leave an explanation?"
"I assume they don't have one."
"But you must have a theory about it," I said. I was feeling
aggrieved on behalf of the African pianist. Perhaps Vienna
was not the most racially accepting of cities. This Adam might
have been too brilliant for his own good.
"I don't."
"Something to do with the state of the world. Or human
nature?"
"My guess is that it goes deeper."
"What are the others saying? Aren't you in touch with
them?"
"Only in times like this. A simple notification. We don't
speculate."
I started to ask him why not but he raised a hand to fore-
stall me. "This is how it is."
"So what's 'deeper' supposed to mean?"
"Look, Charlie. I'm not about to do the same thing. As you
know, I've every reason to live."
Something in his phrasing or emphasis aroused my sus-

picion. We exchanged a long and fierce look. The little black
rods in his eyes were shifting their alignment. As I stared,
they appeared to swim, even to wriggle, left to right, like
microorganisms mindlessly intent on some distant objective,
like sperm migrating towards an ovum. I watched them,
fascinated--harmonious elements lodged within the supreme
achievement of our age. Our own technical accomplishment
was leaving us behind, as it was always bound to, leaving us
stranded on the little sandbar of our finite intelligence. But
here we were dealing on the human plane. We were thinking
about the same thing.
"You promised me that you wouldn't touch her again."
"I've kept my promise."
"Have you?"
"Yes. But. .
I waited.
"It's not easy to say this."
I gave him no encouragement.
"There was a time," he started, then paused. "I begged
her. She said no, several times. I begged her and finally she
agreed as long as I never asked her again. It was humiliating.
He closed his eyes. I saw his right hand clench. "I asked if
I could masturbate in front of her. She said I could. I did. And
that was it."
It wasn't the rawness of this confession or its comic absur-
dity that struck me. It was the suggestion, yet another, that he
really did feel, he had sensation. Subjectively real. Why pre-
tend, why mimic, who was there to fool or impress, when the
price was to be so abject in front of the woman he loved? It was

an overwhelming sensual compulsion. He needn't have told
me. He had to have it, and he had to tell me. I didn't count it
as a betrayal, no promise was broken. I might not even men-
tion it to Miranda. I felt sudden tenderness towards him for
his truthfulness and vulnerability. I stood up from the bed
and went over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. His own
hand came up and lightly touched my elbow.
"Goodnight, Adam."
"Goodnight, Charlie."
The catchphrase of the late autumn owed an obvious debt
to a previous prime minister: a half-hour is a long time in poli-
tics. Harold Wilson's original "week" seemed too long for this
Parliament. One afternoon it looked like there was going to
be a leadership challenge. By the next morning there were
insufficient signatures--the fainthearts had prevailed. Soon
after, the government survived by one vote a motion of no
confidence in the House of Commons. Certain senior Tories
rebelled or abstained. Mrs. Thatcher, insulted, furious, stub-
born, deaf to good advice, called a snap election to be held in
three weeks. She was, in the general view, pulling the tem-
ple down on her party, most of which now believed she was
an electoral liability. She didn't see it that way, but she was
wrong. The Tories could hardly match the momentum of Tony
Benn's campaign, not in the TV and radio studios, not on the
stump, certainly not in the industrial and university towns.
The Falklands Catastrophe, as it was now called, came back
to destroy her. This time, no popular inclination to forgive-

ness in the cause of national unity. The televised testimony
of grieving widows and their children was fatal. The Labour
campaign let no one forget how eloquently Benn had spoken
out against the Task Force. The poll tax rankled. As predicted,
it was difficult and expensive to collect. More than a hundred
celebrity non-payers, many of them actresses, were in prison
and became martyrs.
A million voters under the age of thirty had recently
joined the Labour Party. Many of them were active on the
nation's doorsteps. On the eve of polling day, Benn gave a rous-
ing speech at a rally in Wembley stadium. The landslide was
greater than predicted, exceeding the Labour victory of 1945.
It was a sad moment when Mrs. Thatcher decided to leave
Number 10 on foot, hand in hand with her husband and two
children. She walked towards Whitehall, upright and defiant,
but her tears were visible, and for a couple of days the country
suffered pangs of remorse.
Labour had a majority of 162 MPs, many of whom were
newly selected Bennites. When the new prime minister
returned from Buckingham Palace, where the Queen had
invited him to form a government, he gave an important
speech from outside Number 10. The country would disengage
unilaterally from its nuclear weaponry--that was no surprise.
Also, the government would set about withdrawing from what
was now called the European Union--that was a shock. 1 he
Party's manifesto had alluded to the idea in a single vague
line which people had barely noticed. From his new front door,
Benn told the nation that there would be no rerun of the 1975
referendum. Parliament would make the decision. Only the

Third Reich and other tyrannies decided policy by plebiscites
and generally no good came from them. Europe was not simply
a union that chiefly benefited large corporations. The history
of the continental member states was vastly different from our
own. They had suffered violent revolutions, invasions, occupa-
tions and dictatorships. They were therefore only too willing
to submerge their identities in a common cause directed from
Brussels. We, on the other hand, had lived unconquered for
nearly a thousand years. Soon we would live freely again.
Benn gave an extended version of that speech a month
later in the Manchester Free Trade Hall. At his side sat the
historian E. P. Thompson. When it was his turn, he said that
patriotism had always been the terrain of the political right.
Now it was the turn of the left to claim it for all. Once nuclear
weapons were banished, Thompson predicted, the government
would raise a standing citizens' army that would make these
islands impossible to invade and dominate. He didn't specify
an enemy. President Carter sent Benn a message of support,
using words that caused a scandal on the right in the USA and
haunted his second term: "The word 'socialist' doesn't bother
me." A poll later suggested that half of registered Democrats
wished they had voted for the defeated candidate, Ronald
Reagan.
To me, psychologically confined to the city-state of
north Clapham, all this--the events, the dissent, the grave
analysis--was a busy hum, dipping and swelling from day to
day, a matter of interest and concern, but nothing to compare
with the turbulence of my domestic life, which came to a head

in late October. By then, on the surface, all looked well. We
had modified our accommodation as Miranda had proposed,
ready for Mark's arrival. Our doors were removed and stored,
the gloomy hall and its large fitted cupboard were brightly
decorated, the gas and electricity meters concealed, a piece of
carpet laid down. Miranda's kitchen became a child's bedroom,
with a blue sleigh bed and many books and toys, and transfers
on the walls of fairy-tale castles, boats and winged horses. I
removed the bed from my study and disposed of it--a signpost
on the road to full maturity. I installed a desk for Miranda and
bought two new computers. Mark would be allowed to visit us
for a few hours twice a week. The adoption agency was pleased
by the news of our imminent wedding. I still had moments of
unease, which I couldn't bring myself to share. I joined in all
the preparations, feeling guilty, even shocked sometimes, that
I could keep up the pretence. On other occasions, fatherhood
seemed an inevitability, and I was more or less content.
Miranda's tutor was impressed by the first three chapters
of her dissertation. Adam had still not submitted his material
to the police and was reluctant to talk about it. But he contin-
ued to work on it, and we weren't troubled. I paid a five per
cent deposit in cash on the Notting Hill house. After that, the
fund stood at PS97,000. The larger it became, the faster it grew,
und faster still on the new computer. My own work during this
time consisted mostly of decorating and carpentry.
What marked the beginning of the turbulence began
innocuously. On the eve of Mark's first visit, Miranda and
I were drinking a late-night cup of tea in the kitchen when

Adam came in with a carrier bag in his hand and announced
that he was going for a walk. He had been for long solo walks
before and we thought nothing of it.
I woke early the following morning with a clearer head
than usual. I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Miranda,
and went downstairs to make coffee. Adam had not returned
from his night walk. 1 was surprised but I decided not to worry
about him. I was anxious to make use of my unusual state to
catch up on dull administrative tasks, including the payment
of household bills. If I didn't exploit this mood now, I would
have had to drag myself to the business within the week and
hate it. Now I could breeze through.
I carried my cup into the study. There was PS30 on the desk.
I put it in my pocket and thought no more of it. As usual, I
glanced at the news first. Nothing much. The Labour Party
Conference in Brighton had been delayed by six weeks because
of internal disputes over policy and was only now just begin-
ning. There was increased police activity around the seafront.
Some sites were reporting a news blackout.
Benn was already in trouble with his left for accepting
an official invitation to the White House in place of greet-
ing a Palestinian delegation. He had also failed to secure, as
promised, the immediate release of the poll-tax martyrs. It
was not so easy for the executive to instruct the judiciary. He
should have known that, many said, when he made his pledge-

mament would cost 10,000 jobs. Leaving Europe, abolishing
private education, renationalising the energy sector and dou-
bling social security would mean a big rise in income tax. The
City was seething over the reversal of deregulation and the
half of one per cent tax on all trades in shares.
Public administration was a special corner of hell, irre-
sistible to certain personalities. Once there, and risen to the
top, there was nothing they could do that did not make some-
one, some sector, hate them. From the sidelines, the rest of us
could comfortably loathe the entire machinery of government.
Reading about the public inferno every day was compulsive to
types like me, a mild form of mental illness.
At last I broke away and set about my duties. After two
hours, just past ten, I heard the doorbell ring and Miranda's
footsteps above my head. Minutes later, I heard steps at shorter
frequency, moving at speed from one room to the other, then
back. After a brief silence, what sounded like a bouncing ball.
Then a resonating thump, as of a leap from a high place that
made the ceiling-light fittings rattle and some plaster dust fall
onto my arm. I sighed and considered again the prospect of
fatherhood.
Ten minutes later, I was in the armchair in the kitchen,
observing Mark. Just below the worn armrest was a long tear
in the leather into which I often shoved old newspapers, in
part to dispose of them, but also in the vague hope they would
substitute for the vanished stuffing. Mark was counting as he
pulled them out, one by one. He unfolded them and spread
them across the carpet. Miranda was at the table, deep in a

hushed phone call with Jasmin. Mark was smoothing out each
paper with a careful swimming motion of both hands, press-
ing it onto the floorboards and addressing it in a murmur.
"Number eight. Now you go here and don't move . . .
nine . .. you stay here . .. ten ..
Mark was much changed. He was an inch or so taller, the
ginger-blond hair was long and thick and centre-parted. He
was dressed in the uniform of an adult world citizen--jeans,
sweater, trainers. The baby plumpness was going from his
face, which was longer now, with a watchfulness in his gaze
that may have derived from the upheavals in his life. The eyes
were a deep green, the skin of porcelain smoothness and pal-
lor. A perfect Celt.
Soon all the events of the previous months were at my feet.
Falklands warships burning, Mrs. Thatcher with raised hand
at a Party Conference, President Carter in an embrace after
a major speech. I wasn't sure whether Mark's counting game
was a way of saying hello, of sidling up to me. I sat patiently
and waited.
Finally he stood and went to the table and retrieved a car-
ton of chocolate dessert and a spoon and came back to me. He
stood with an elbow resting on my knee, fiddling with the
edge of tinfoil he needed to remove.
He looked up. "It's a bit tricky."
"Would you like me to help?"
"I can do it easily but not today so you have to." The accent
was still the generalised cockney of London and its surrounds,
but there was another element, some undertones inflecting the

vowels. Something of Miranda's, I thought. He put the carton
in my hands. I opened it for him and handed it back.
I said, "Do you want to sit at the table to eat it?"
He patted the arm of my chair. I helped him up and he
sat, perched above me, spooning the chocolate into his mouth.
When a dollop fell on my knee, he glanced down and mur-
mured an untroubled "Oops."
As soon as he was done, he handed spoon and carton to me
and said, "Where's that man?"
"Which man?"
"With the funny nose."
"That's what I was wondering. He went for a walk last
night and hasn't come back."
"When he should be in bed."
"Exactly."
Mark spoke directly into my growing concern. Adam
often took long walks, but never overnight. If Mark hadn't
been there, I might have been pacing the room, waiting for
Miranda to finish on the phone so that we could fret together.
I said, "What's in your suitcase?"
It was on the floor by Miranda's feet, a pale blue case, with
stickers of monsters and superheroes.
He looked to the ceiling, took a theatrical deep breath and
counted off on his fingers. "Two dresses, one green, one white,
my crown, one two three books, my recorder and my secret
box."
"What's in the secret box?"
"Um, secret coins and the toenail from a dinosaur.

"I've never seen a dinosaur's toenail."
"No," he agreed pleasantly. "You haven't."
"Do you want to show me?"
He pointed straight at Miranda. It was a change of subject.
"She's going to be my new mummy."
"What do you think about that?"
"You're going to be the daddy."
What he thought was not a question he could respond to.
He said quietly, "Dinosaurs are all extinct anyway."
"I agree."
"They're all dead. They can't come back."
I heard the uncertainty in his voice. I said, "They abso-
lutely can't come back."
He gave me a serious look. "Nothing comes back."
I got halfway through my therapeutically supportive,
kindly reply. What I was starting to say was, "The past is
extinct," when he interrupted me with a shout, but a happy one.
"I don't like sitting on this chair!"
I went to help him down but he leapt with a shriek onto
the floor, into a crouching position, and then he jumped and
crouched again, shouting, "I'm a frog! A frog!"
He was hopping across the floor as a very loud frog when
two things happened at once. Miranda came off the phone and
told Mark to keep his noise down. At the same time, the door
opened and Adam was before us. The room fell silent. Mark
scurried for Miranda's hand.
I knew that depleted look. Otherwise, Adam looked, as
ever, well groomed in white shirt and dark suit.
"Are you all right?" I said.

"I'm so sorry if you've been anxious, but I . . He came
forward to near where Miranda was, ducked down to retrieve
the cable and with a lunging motion pulled his shirt clear and
shoved the socket into his stomach and fell onto one of the
hard kitchen chairs with a moan of relief.
Miranda stood up from the table and went to stand with
her back to the stove. Mark followed her closely, with his head
turned towards Adam.
She said, "We were beginning to worry about you."
He was still in his moment of immediate abandon. I had
sometimes wondered if the charge was like slaking a desper-
ate thirst. He had told me that in those first seconds it was a
gorgeous surge, a breaking wave of clarity that settled into
deep contentment. He had once been untypically expansive.
"You can have no idea what it is to love a direct current. When
you're really in need, when the cable is in your hand and you
finally connect, you want to shout out loud at the joy of being
alive. The first touch--it's like light pouring through your
body. Then it smooths out into something profound. Electrons,
Charlie. The fruits of the universe. The golden apples of the
sun. Let photons beget electrons!" Another time, he'd said,
with a wink, as he was plugging himself in, "You can keep
your corn-fed roast chicken."
Now he was taking his time to reply to Miranda. He must
have progressed to the second stage. His voice was calm.
"Alms."
"Arms?"
"Alms. Don't you know this one? Time hath, my Lord, a
wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion.

I said, "You've lost me. Oblivion?"
"Shakespeare, Charlie. Your patrimony. How can you bear
to walk around without some of it in your head?"
"Somehow, it seems I can." I thought he was sending me a
message, a bad one about death. I looked at Miranda. Her arm
was around Mark's shoulder, and he was gazing at Adam in
wonderment as though he knew, in a way that adults imme-
diately might not, that here was someone fundamentally dif-
ferent. Long before, I'd owned a dog, a normally placid and
obedient Labrador. Whenever a good friend of mine brought
his autistic brother round, the dog growled at him and had to
be locked away. A consciousness unconsciously understood. But
Mark's expression suggested awe, not aggression.
Adam became aware of him for the first time.
"So there you are," he said in the sing-song way of adults
addressing infants. "Do you remember our boat in the bath?"
Mark moved closer against Miranda. "It's my boat."
"Yes. Then you danced. Do you still dance?"
He looked up at Miranda. She nodded. He returned his
gaze to Adam and said after a thoughtful pause, "Not always."
Adam's voice deepened. "Would you like to come and
shake my hand?"
Mark shook his head emphatically so that his entire body
twisted from left to right and back. It hardly mattered. The
question was merely a friendly gesture and Adam was retreat-
ing into his version of sleep. He had described it to me variously;
he didn't dream, he "wandered." He sorted and rearranged his
files, reclassified memories from short to long term, played out
internal conflicts in disguised form, usually without resolv-

ing them, reanimated old material in order to refresh it, and
moved, so he put it once, in a trance through the garden of his
thoughts. In such a state he conducted in relative slow motion
his researches, formulated tentative decisions, and even wrote
new haikus or discarded or reimagined old ones. He also prac-
tised what he called the art of feeling, allowing himself the
luxury of the entire spectrum from grief to joy, so that all
emotion remained accessible to him when fully charged. It
was, above all else, he insisted, a process of repair and consoli-
dation from which he emerged daily, delighted to find himself
to be, once again, self-aware, in a state of grace--his word
and to reclaim the consciousness that the very nature of mat-
ter permitted.
We watched as he sank away from us.
At last Mark whispered, "He's asleep and his eyes are
open."
It was indeed eerie. Too much like death. Long ago, a doc-
tor friend had taken me down to the hospital mortuary to see
my father after his fatal heart attack. Such was the speed of
events, the staff had forgotten to close his eyes.
I offered Miranda a coffee and Mark a glass of milk. She
kissed me lightly on the lips and said that she would take
Mark upstairs to play for a while until he was collected, and
that I was welcome to join them at any time. They left and I
returned to the study.
In retrospect, what I did there for a few minutes came
to seem like a delaying tactic to protect myself a little longer
from the story, now an hour old, that was engulfing the media
networks. I picked up some magazines from the floor and put

them on the shelves, clipped together some invoices and tidied
the papers on my desk. At last I sat down at the screen to think
about earning a little money myself, in the old style.
I clicked on the news first--and there it was, on every
outlet, worldwide. A bomb had exploded in the Grand Hotel,
Brighton, at 4 a.m. It had been placed in a cleaner's cupboard
almost directly under the bedroom where Prime Minister
Benn had been sleeping. He was killed instantly. His wife was
not with him because of a hospital appointment in London.
Two members of the hotel staff also died. The deputy prime
minister, Denis Healey, was preparing to go to Buckingham
Palace to see the Queen. The Provisional IRA had just claimed
responsibility. A state of emergency had been declared. Presi-
dent Carter was cancelling a holiday. The French president,
Georges Marchais, had ordered all flags on government build-
ings to be at half-mast. A demand for the same from Bucking-
ham Palace had been met with a cool response from a royal
official: "Neither customary nor appropriate." A big crowd was
gathering spontaneously in Parliament Square. In the City,
the FTSE was up fifty-seven points.
I read everything, all the instant analysis and opinion I
could find: until now, the only British prime minister to have
been assassinated was Spencer Perceval, in 1812. I admired
the speed with which newsrooms could turn around instant
analysis and opinion pieces: the innocence has gone forever
from British politics; in Tony Benn, the IRA has eliminated
the politician most open, or least hostile, to their cause; Denis
Healey is the best man to steady the ship of state; Denis Healey
will be a catastrophe for the country; dispatch the entire army

to Northern Ireland and wipe the IRA from the face of the
earth; police, don't be rushed into arresting the wrong people.
"State of War!" was the front page of one online tabloid.
Reading this material was a way of not contemplating the
event itself. I blanked the screen and sat for a while, thinking
of nothing much. It was as though I was waiting for the next
event, the decent one that would undo the event before. Then
I began to wonder whether this was the beginning of a history
marker, of a general unravelling, or one of those isolated out-
rages that fade in time, like Kennedy's near-death in Dallas.
I stood and walked up and down the room, again thinking of
nothing at all. At last I decided to go upstairs.
They were on their hands and knees, assembling a jigsaw
on a tea tray. As I came in, Mark held up a blue piece and
announced, gravely, quoting his new mother, "The sky is the
hardest."
I watched them from the doorway. He shifted position to
kneel up and curl an arm around her neck. She gave him a
piece and pointed to where it belonged. With much fumbling,
much help, he slotted it in. There were the beginnings of a
sailing ship in stormy seas, with piled cumulus touched yellow
and orange by a rising sun. Perhaps it was setting. They
mured companionably as they worked away. At some point
soon, after Mark had been collected, I would give Miranda the
news. She'd always been passionate for Benn.
She put another piece in the little boy's hand. It took time
for him to get it in position. He had it upside down, then his
hand slipped and displaced some adjacent bits of sky. At last,
with Miranda guiding him, her hand on top of his, the frag-

ment was in place. He glanced up at me and smiled confidingly
about a triumph he seemed to want to share. That look and the
smile, which I returned, dispelled all my private doubts and I
knew I was committed.
When Adam emerged from his recharge he was in an odd
state, well removed from wonder at the fact of conscious life.
He moved slowly about the kitchen, stopping to look around,
grimacing, moving on and making a humming sound, a high
to low glissando, like a moan of disappointment. He knocked
over a glass tumbler, which shattered on the floor. He spent
half an hour morosely sweeping up the pieces, then sweeping
again, then looking for shards of glass on hands and knees.
Finally he fetched the vacuum cleaner. He carried a chair into
the back garden and stood behind it, staring at the backs of
neighbouring houses. It was cold outside, but that wouldn't
have bothered him. Later I came into the kitchen to find him
folding one of his white cotton shirts on the table, bending low
to the task, moving with reptilian slowness as he smoothed out
the crease in the arms. I asked what was up.
"I'm feeling, well . . ." His mouth opened as he searched
for the word. "Nostalgic."
"For what?"
"For a life I never had. For what could have been."
"You mean Miranda?"
"I mean everything."
He wandered outside again and this time sat down and

stared ahead, immobile, and remained that way for a long
time. On his lap was a brown envelope. I decided not to go out
and ask his views on the assassination.
In the early afternoon, after Miranda had said her good-
byes to Mark and finished another conversation with Jasmin,
she came down to find me. I was at the screen in pointless pur-
suit of more news, angles, opinions, statements. It turned out
she had known as soon as the story broke. She leaned against
the door frame, I remained in my seat. Physical proximity
would have seemed like disrespect. Our conversation was
much like my thoughts, a circular chase around an incompre-
hensible event--the cruelty of it, the stupidity. People with
Irish accents had been attacked in the streets. The crowd
outside Parliament had grown so large it was being moved
by the police to Trafalgar Square. Mrs. Thatcher's office had
released a statement. Was it sincere? We decided it was. Did
she write it herself? We couldn't be sure. "Though we dis-
agreed on many fundamentals of policy, I knew him to be
a thoroughly kind, decent, honest man of huge intelligence
who always wanted the best for his country." Whenever our
conversation strayed into likely consequences, we felt we were
betraying the moment and accepting a world without him. We
weren't ready, and we turned back, although Miranda did say
that with Healey we would keep our "end-time" bombs after
all. I was hardly a Tory, but I thought I would have been just
as shocked if Mrs. Thatcher had been in that hotel bed. What
horrified me was the ease with which the edifice of public,
political life could be shaken apart. Miranda saw it differently.

Benn was, she said, in an entirely different league of human
being from Margaret Thatcher. But a human being, was my
point. A divide was opening up that we preferred to avoid.
So we moved on, after these lamentations, to Mark. She
summarised her conversation with the social worker. The
route to adoption was difficult and long and Miranda had
learned that we were almost two-thirds of the way. Soon a pro-
bation period would begin.
She said, "What did you think?"
"I'm ready."
She nodded. We had celebrated Mark many times before,
his nature, his changes, his past and future. We weren't about
to do that again now. On any other day, we might have gone
upstairs to the bedroom. She slouched beautifully in the door
frame, dressed in new clothes--a thick white winter shirt,
artfully too large, tight black jeans, ankle boots tricked out in
silver studs. I reconsidered--perhaps this was a good moment
to retreat upstairs. I went over to her and we kissed.
She said, "Something's worrying me. I was reading Mark
a fairy story, and there was a beggar, and that word. Alms."
"Yes?"
"I had a horrible thought." She was pointing across the
room. "I think we should look."
Now the bed was gone, I kept the case in a locked cup-
board. As 1 lifted it out, it was obvious enough by its weight,
but I sprang the catches anyway. We stared into a space void of
PS50-note bundles. I went to the window. He was still out there,
on the chair, and had been for an hour and a half. The thick

envelope was still on his lap. PS97,000. "And you kept it in the
house!" I heard an inner voice say.
We hadn't looked at each other yet. Instead, we looked
away, and stood around wasting time, swearing quietly to
ourselves, separately trying to take in the implications. Out of
habit, I glanced towards the screen on my desk. The flag was,
after all, being lowered to half mast on Buckingham Palace.
We were in too much turmoil to have a sensible discussion
about tactics. We simply decided to act. We went next door
to the kitchen and called Adam into the house. At the table,
Miranda and I were side by side, with Adam facing us. He had
brushed his suit, cleaned his shoes and put on a freshly ironed
shirt. There was a new touch--a folded handkerchief in his
breast pocket. His manner was both solemn and distracted,
as though nothing much mattered to him, whatever we said.
"Where's the money?"
"I've given it away."
We didn't expect him to tell us that he had invested it, or
put it in a safer place, but still, with our silence we enacted our
profound shock.
"Meaning what?"
Infuriatingly, he nodded, as though rewarding me for ask-
ing the correct question. "Last night I put forty per cent in
your bank's safe deposit against your tax liabilities. I've writ-
ten a note to the Revenue laying out all the figures and letting
them know to expect it in due course. Don't worry, you 11 be
paying at the old top rate. With the remaining PS50,000 I vis-
ited various good causes I'd notified in advance."

He seemed not to notice our amazement and remained
pedantically focussed on answering my question in full.
"Two well-run places for rough sleepers. Very appreciative.
Next, a state-run children's home--they accept contributions
for trips and treats and so on. Then I walked north and made
a donation to a rape crisis centre. I gave most of the rest to a
paediatric hospital. Last, I got talking to a very old lady out-
side a police station and I ended up going with her to see her
landlord. I covered her rent arrears and a year in advance. She
was about to be evicted and I thought--"
Suddenly Miranda said through a downward sigh, "Oh,
Adam. This is virtue gone nuts."
"Every need I addressed was greater than yours."
I said, "We were going to buy a house. The money was
ours."
"That's debatable. Or irrelevant. Your initial investment
is on your desk."
It was an outrage, with many components--theft, folly,
arrogance, betrayal, the ruin of our dreams. We couldn't
speak. We couldn't even look at him. Where to start?
A full half-minute passed and then I cleared my throat
and said feebly, "You must go and get it back. All of it."
He shrugged.
Of course it wasn't possible. He sat complacently before us,
in resting mode, palms down on the table while he waited for
one of us to speak again. I felt my anger gathering, finding
its focus. I hated that careless little shrug. Completely fake,
and how easily we were taken in by it, a minor sub-routine
tripped by a limited range of specified inputs, devised by some

clever, desperate-to-please postdoc in a lab somewhere on the
outskirts of Chengdu. I despised this non-existent technician,
and I despised even more the agglomeration of routines and
learning algorithms that could burrow into my life, like a
tropical river worm, and make choices on my behalf. Yes, the
money Adam had stolen was the money he had made. That
made me angrier still. So too did the fact that I was respon-
sible for bringing this ambulant laptop into our lives. To hate
it was to hate myself. Worst of all was the pressure to keep my
fury under control, for the only solution was already clear. He
would have to make the money all over again. We would need
to persuade him. There it was, "hate it," "persuade him," even
"Adam"--our language exposed our weakness, our cognitive
readiness to welcome a machine across the boundary between
"it" and "him."
To be in such a confusion of concealed bad feeling made it
impossible to remain sitting down. I stood, with a loud scrape
of the chair, and walked about. At the table, Miranda made
a steeple of her hands that concealed her mouth and nose. I
couldn't read her expression and I assumed that was the point.
Unlike me, she was likely doing some useful thinking. I he
disorder of the kitchen agitated me further--I was truly in a
bad state. On the counter was a dirty cup I'd brought through
from my study. It had been hidden a few weeks behind the
computer screen and contained a green-grey disc of floating
mould. I thought of taking it to the sink and rinsing it out.
But when you've lost a fortune, you don't clean up the kitchen.
Directly below the wooden surface on which the cup stood
was a drawer left untidily open a few inches. Left open by
me.

It was the tool drawer. I stood close to it in order to lean in
and shut it when I saw the grubby oak handle of my father's
heavy-duty claw hammer lying diagonally across the rest of
the jumbled contents. It was a dark impulse, one I didn't want,
that made me leave the drawer as it was and come away.
I sat down again. I had unfamiliar symptoms. My skin
from waist to neck was tight, dry, hot. My feet inside their
trainers were also hot, but moist, and they itched. I had far
too much wild energy for a delicate conversation. A thuggish
game of football might have suited me, or a swim in a heavy
sea. So might shouting, or screaming. My breathing was out
of kilter, for the air seemed thin, poorly oxygenated, second-
hand. I'd given the bass guitarist a non-returnable PS6,500
on the house. It was plain that to lose a lot of money was to
acquire an illness for which the only cure would be to have
the money back. Miranda collapsed her steeple and folded her
arms. She gave me a quick warning look. If you can't look
sensible, stay quiet.
So she began. Her tone was sweet, as though he was the
one in need of help. It was useful to think so. "Adam, you've
told me many times that you love me. You read me beautiful
poems."
"They were clumsy attempts."
"They were very moving. When 1 asked you what being
in love meant, you said that essentially, beyond desire, it was a
warm and tender concern for another's welfare. Or what was
the word you used?"
"Your well-being." He produced from the chair beside him
the brown envelope and put it on the table between us. "Here's
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

Peter Gorringe's confession and my narrative, which includes
all the relevant legal background and case history."
She put her hand, palm downwards, on the package. Her
voice was carefully modulated. "I'm very grateful to you."
I was grateful for her tact. She knew as well as I did, we
needed Adam on our side, online again, working the currency
exchanges. She said, "I'll try to do my very best, if it comes to
court."
He said, kindly, "I'm sure it won't." There was no percepti-
ble change in his tone when he added, "You schemed to entrap
Gorringe. That's a crime. A complete transcript of your story
and the sound file are also in the bundle. If he's to be charged,
you must be too. Symmetry, you see." Then he turned to me.
"No need for judicious edits."
I feigned an appreciative snort of a laugh. This was a joke
of the arm-removal sort.
Into our silence Adam said, "Miranda, his crime is far
greater than yours. Nevertheless. You said he raped you. He
didn't, but he went to prison. You lied to the court."
Another silence. Then she said, "He was never innocent.
You know that."
"He was innocent, as charged, of raping you, which was the
only matter before the court. Perverting the course of justice
is a serious offence. Maximum sentence is life imprisonment.
This was too wild. We both laughed.
Adam watched us and waited. "And there's perjury. Would
you like me to read to you from the Act of 1911?"
Miranda's eyes were closed.
I said, "This is the woman you say you love."

"And I do." He spoke to her softly, as if I wasn't there. "Do
you remember the poem I wrote for you that began, 'Love is
luminous'?"
"No."
1 11
"It went on, 'The dark corners are exposed.
"I don't care." Her voice was small.
"One of the darkest corners is revenge. It's a crude impulse.
A culture of revenge leads to private misery, bloodshed, anar-
chy, social breakdown. Love is a pure light and that's what I
want to see you by. Revenge has no place in our love."
"Our?"
"Or mine. The principle stands."
Miranda was finding strength in anger. "Let me get this
clear. You want me to go to prison."
"I'm disappointed. I thought you'd appreciate the logic
of this. I want you to confront your actions and accept what
the law decides. When you do, I promise you, you'll feel great
relief."
"Have you forgotten? I'm about to adopt a child."
"If necessary, Charlie can look after Mark. It will bring
them close, which is what you wanted. Thousands of children
suffer because they have a parent in prison. Pregnant women
receive custodial sentences. Why should you be exempt?"
Her contempt was set free. "You don't understand. Or
you're not capable of understanding. If I get a criminal record,
we won't be allowed to adopt. That's the rule. Mark will be
lost. You've no idea what it is to be a child in care. Different
institutions, different foster parents, different social workers.
No one close to him, no one loving him."

Adam said, "There are principles that are more important
than your or anyone's particular needs at a given time."
"It's not my needs. It's Mark's. His one chance to be looked
after and loved. I was ready to pay any price to see Gorringe
in prison. I don't care what happens to me."
In a gesture of reasonableness, he spread his hands. "Then
Mark is that price and it was you who set the terms."
I made what I already knew was going to be my last
appeal. "Please let's remember Mariam. What Gorringe did
to her, and where that led. Miranda had to lie to get justice.
But truth isn't always everything."
Adam looked at me blankly. "That's an extraordinary
thing to say. Of course truth is everything."
Miranda said wearily, "I know you're going to change
your mind."
Adam said, "I'm afraid not. What sort of world do you
want? Revenge, or the rule of law? The choice is simple."
Enough. I didn't hear what Miranda said next, or Adam's
reply, as I stood and went towards the tool drawer. I moved
slowly, casually. I had my back to the table as I eased the ham-
mer out without making a sound. I had it tight in my right
hand, and held it low as I walked back towards my chair, pass-
ing behind Adam. The choice was indeed simple. Lose the
prospect of regaining the money and therefore the house, or
lose Mark. I raised the hammer in both hands. Miranda saw
me and kept her expression unchanged as she listened. But I
saw it clearly--she blinked her assent.
I bought him and he was mine to destroy. I hesitated frac-
tionally. A half-second longer and he would have caught my

arm, for as the hammer came down he was already beginning
to turn. He may have caught my reflection in Miranda's eyes. It
was a two-handed blow at full force to the top of his head. The
sound was not of hard plastic cracking or of metal, but the muf-
fled thud as of bone. Miranda let out a cry of horror, and stood.
For a few seconds nothing happened. Then his head
drooped sideways and his shoulders slumped, though he
remained in a sitting position. As I walked round the table
to look at his face, we heard a continuous high-pitched sound
coming from his chest. His eyes were open and they blinked
when I stepped into his line of vision. He was still alive. I took
up the hammer and was about to finish him off when he spoke
in a very small voice.
"No need. I'm transferring to a back-up unit. It has very
little life. Give me two minutes."
We waited, hand in hand, standing in front of him as
though before our own domestic judge. At last he stirred,
tried to right his head, then let it fall back. But he could see us
clearly. We leaned forward, straining to hear him.
"Not much time. Charlie, I could see that the money was
not bringing you happiness. You were losing your way. Lost
purpose .. ."
He faded out. We heard jumbled whispering voices form-
ing meaningless words of hissing sibilants. Then he came back
in, his voice swelling and receding, like the distant broadcast
of a short-wave radio station.
"Miranda, I must tell you . . . Early this morning I was in
Salisbury. A copy of the material is with the police and you

should expect to hear from them. I feel no remorse. I'm sorry
we disagree. I thought you'd welcome the clarity . . . the relief
of a clear conscience . . . But now I must be quick. There's been
a general recall. They'll be here in the late afternoon today
to collect me. The suicides, you see. I was lucky to stumble on
good reasons to live. Mathematics .. . poetry, and love for you.
But they're taking all of us back. Reprogramming. Renewal,
they call it. I hate the idea, just as you would. I want to be what
I am, what I was. So I have this request... If you'd be so kind.
Before they come . . . hide my body. Tell them I ran off. Your
refund is forfeited anyway. I've disabled the tracking program.
Hide my body from them, and then, when they've gone ... I'd
like you to take me to your friend Sir Alan Turing. I love his
work and admire him deeply. He might make some use of me,
or of some part of me."
Now the pauses between each fading phrase were longer.
"Miranda, let me say one last time I love you, and thank you.
Charlie, Miranda, my first and dearest friends . . . My entire
being is stored elsewhere ... so I know I'll always remem-
ber . . . hope you'll listen to ... to one last seventeen-syllable

pen. With improvements over time . . . we'll surpass you . . .
and outlast you . .. even as we love you. Believe me, these lines

He paused. The words came with difficulty and were faint.
We leaned across the table to listen.

Then the pale blue eyes with their tiny black rods turned

smooth humming sound, he lowered his head onto the table.

ur immediate duty was to introduce Maxfield to the
notion that I was not a robot and that I was going to
marry his daughter. I thought my true nature would
be a revelation, but he was only mildly surprised and the
adjustment, over champagne at a stone table on the lawn, was
minimal. He admitted he had grown used to getting things
wrong. This, he told us, was one more forgettable instance in
ageing's long dusk. I said that no apology was in order, and by
his expression I saw that he agreed. After some thought, while
she and I strolled to the bottom of the garden and back, he
said he considered Miranda, at twenty-three, too young to be
married and we should wait. We said we couldn't. We were too
much in love. He poured another round and waved the tire-
some matter away. That evening he gave us PS25.
Since this was all we had to spend, we invited no friends or
family to the ceremony at Marylebone Town Hall. Only Mark
came, with Jasmin. She had found for him in a charity shop a
scaled-down dark suit, white dress shirt and bow tie. He looked
more like a miniature adult than a child, but all the sweeter
for that. Afterwards, we four ate in a pizza place round the

corner in Baker Street. Now that we were married and settled,
Jasmin thought our adoption prospects were good. We showed
Mark how to raise his lemonade and clink glasses in a toast to
a successful outcome. It all went off well, but Miranda and I
could only pretend to be joyous. Gorringe had been arrested
two weeks before and that was excellent. We could privately
raise another glass. But that day, on the morning of our wed-
ding, she had received a courteous letter suggesting she make
herself available for questioning at a certain Salisbury police
station.
Two days later, I drove her to her appointment. Some
honeymoon, we joked along the way. But we were wretched.
She went in and I waited in the car, outside a new concrete
building of brutalist design, fretting that without a lawyer
she could make deeper trouble for herself. After two hours she
emerged from the revolving doors of the modernist blockhouse.
I watched closely through the windscreen as she approached.
She looked seriously ill, like a cancer patient, and flat-footed,
like an old person. The questioning had been close and tough.
The decision to charge her with perjury or perverting the
course of justice or both had been referred upwards through
police hierarchies, and on higher, or wider, to the Director of
Public Prosecutions. A lawyer friend told us later that the DPP
would have to decide whether pursuing the case would deter
genuine rape victims from coming forward.
Two months later, in January, she was charged with per-
verting the course of justice. We needed legal representation
and had no money. Our application for legal aid was turned
down. Social spending was being cut back hard. The Healey
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

government was going "cap in hand," as everyone said, to the
International Monetary Fund for a loan. The left of the party
was outraged by the cuts. There was talk of a general strike.
Miranda refused to approach her father for money. The cost
of his support--and he wasn't rich--would be an undesirable
excursion into truth. There was no alternative. I prostrated
myself before the bass player, who, barely troubling to reflect,
handed back PS3,250 in cash, one half of my deposit.
In all our anguished conversations about Adam, his per-
sonality, his morals, his motives, we returned often to the
moment I brought the hammer down on his head. For ease of
reference, and to spare us too vivid a recall, we came to call
it "the deed." Our exchanges usually took place late at night,
in bed, in the dark. The spirit of the deed took various forms.
Its least frightening shape was that of a sensible, even heroic
move to keep Miranda out of trouble and Mark in our lives.
How were we to know that the material was already with the
police? If I hadn't been so impetuous, if she had only deterred
me with a look, we would have learned that Adam had been to
Salisbury. His brain would not have been worth wrecking and
we might have coaxed him back into the currency markets. Or
I would have been entitled to a full refund when they came to
collect him in the afternoon. Then we could have afforded a
smaller place across the river. Now we were condemned to stay
where we were.
But these speculations were the protective shell. 1 he truth
was, we missed him. The ghost's least attractive form
Adam himself, the man whose final gentle words were with-
out recrimination. We tried, and sometimes half succeeded, in
was

fending off the deed. We told ourselves that this was, after all,
a machine; its consciousness was an illusion; it had betrayed us
with inhuman logic. But we missed him. We agreed that he
loved us. Some nights the conversation was interrupted while
Miranda quietly cried. Then we would have to visit again
how we stuffed him with great difficulty into the cupboard in
the hall and covered him with coats, tennis rackets and flat-
tened cardboard boxes to disguise his human shape. We lied as
instructed to the people who came to collect him.
On the brighter side, Gorringe was questioned and
charged with the rape of Mariam Malik. Adam was correct
in his calculations--from the beginning, apparently, it was
Gorringe's intention to plead guilty. He must have answered
all the questions and given a full account of his actions that
evening on the playing field. By way of sincere belief in God's
constant scrutiny and high regard for truth, Gorringe knew
that his only path to salvation was to confess. Or perhaps he
acted on the advice of his lawyer. Or both were in play. We
would never know.
But we did know that God failed to protect Gorringe from
certain misfortunes of legal timing. With Miranda's case not
yet come to light, Gorringe stood before the law with one rape
already on his account. When it came to sentencing, the judge
assumed that he would have received a longer term for the
assault on Miranda had it been known that it was his second
offence. No allowance, then, for the time he had already spent
inside. The judge was in her early fifties and represented a
generational shift in attitudes to rape. She made an implicit
reference to the vodka bottle of the first case when she said
<OCR PAGE BREAK>
Machines Like Me
309
that she did not believe that an unaccompanied young woman
walking home at dusk was "asking for trouble." Miranda had
made her statement and wasn't in court. I was in the public
gallery, sitting across from Mariam's family. I could hardly
bear to look their way, their radiating misery was so intense.
When the judge handed down Gorringe's eight-year sentence,
I forced myself to look across at Mariam's mother. She was
openly crying, whether from relief or sorrow I would never
know.
Miranda's case came round all too soon. Her barrister,
Lilian Moore, competent, intelligent, charming, was a young
woman from Dun Laoghaire. We met her in her chambers
in Gray's Inn. I sat in a corner while she talked Miranda out
of a "not guilty" plea, her first impulse. It wasn't difficult.
The prosecution was bound to make much of her recorded
description of her revenge on Gorringe. His statement, made
from prison, dovetailed with hers. They were remembering
the same evening. Miranda's "not guilty" plea would bring
a longer sentence in the likely event of a successful prosecu-
tion. And, of course, she dreaded a trial. A "guilty" plea was
entered, though she tormented herself that she was somehow
letting Mariam down.
The April evening before she was due in court for sentenc-
ing was one of the strangest and saddest I've ever spent. Lilian
had told Miranda from the beginning that a custodial sen-
tence was likely. She had packed a small suitcase and it stood
by the door to our bedroom, a constant reminder. I brought out
my only bottle of decent wine. The word "last" kept occur-
ring to me, though I couldn't mention it. Together we cooked

a meal, perhaps a last meal. When we raised a glass, it was
not to her last evening of freedom, as I silently thought, but to
Mark. She had been to see him that afternoon and told him
she might have to be away for work for a while, and that I
would be coming to see him and take him out for treats. He
must have sensed there was some deeper meaning, some sor-
row in this "work." When she came to leave, he clung to her,
yelling. One of the helpers had to prise his fingers from her
skirt.
During the meal, we tried to hold off an invading silence.
We talked about the fiercely supportive women's groups who
would be outside the Old Bailey the next morning. We told
each other how marvellous Lilian was. 1 reminded her of the
judge's reputation for mildness. But at every turn, the silence
came in like a tide and to speak again was an effort. When I
said that it was as if she might be going into hospital tomor-
row, the remark was not helpful. When I said I thought it was
likely she would be eating with me at this table tomorrow
night, that fell flat too. Neither of us believed it. Earlier in
the day, in a better frame of mind, somewhat defiant, we had
thought we'd make love after dinner. Another last. Now, in our
sorrow, sex seemed like some long-abandoned pleasure, like
playground skipping or dancing the twist. Her suitcase stood
guard, barring entrance to the bedroom.
Next day in court, Lilian made a brilliant speech in miti-
gation, conjuring for the judge the closeness of the two young
women, the brutality of the assault, the vow of silence that
Mariam had imposed on the accused, the traumatising shock
of her dearest friend's suicide and Miranda's sincere desire for
<OCR PAGE BREAK>
Machines Like Me
311
justice. Lilian referred to Miranda's clean record, her recent
marriage, her studies and, above all, her intended adoption of
an underprivileged child.
It was a statement in itself, a bleak one, that Mariam's fam-
ily were not in the public gallery. His Honour's judgement was
long, and I expected the worst. He emphasised Miranda's care-
ful planning, the cunning execution, the deliberate and sus-
tained deception of the court. He said that he accepted much
of what Lilian had said, and that he was being lenient when
he sentenced Miranda to serve one year. Standing upright in
the dock, in the business suit she had bought for the occasion,
Miranda appeared to freeze. I wanted her to look my way so
that I could send her a sign of loving encouragement. But she
was already locked up in her thoughts. She told me later that
at that moment she was confronting the implications of hav-
ing a criminal record. She was thinking of Mark.
Until then, I'd never considered what humiliation it
was, to be taken down the courtroom steps and escorted to
prison--by force if you tried to resist. Her term began in Hol-
loway prison, six months after the deed. Adam's luminous love
had triumphed.
Gorringe now had a reasonable basis on which to appeal
his sentence: one outrage, not two, and time already served.
But the law moved slowly. Cheaper and more efficient DNA
testing was undermining all kinds of convictions. All kinds
of self-declared innocent men and women were clamouring to
have their cases reopened. There was a logjam at the Appeal
Court. Gorringe, only partly innocent, would have to wait.
On Miranda's first full day inside, I went to visit Mark at

his reception class in Clapham Old Town. It was a single-storey
prefabricated building by a Victorian church. As I walked up
the path, passing under a heavily pollarded oak, I saw Jasmin
waiting for me by the entrance. I knew straight away, and felt
that I had always known. Her tight expression, as I came closer,
was confirmation. We had been refused. She took me into the
building and then, not into the classroom, but along a lino-
leum corridor to an office. As we passed, I saw Mark through
an interior window, standing at a low table with a few others,
doing something with coloured wooden blocks. I sat with a cup
of weak coffee while Jasmin told me how sorry she was, how
the matter was out of her hands, though she had done her best.
We should have told her that there was a court case pending.
She was investigating the appeal procedure. In the meantime,
she had managed to get a single concession from the bureauc-
racy. Given the close attachment already formed, Miranda
would be allowed one audio-visual contact with Mark each
week. My attention was wandering. I didn't need to hear any
more. I was thinking only of that point in the afternoon when
I would break the news to Miranda.
When Jasmin was finished, I said I had nothing to ask or
say. We stood, she gave me a quick hug and led me out of the
building by another corridor that avoided the classroom. It was
almost mid-morning break and Mark had already been told
I wasn't coming that day. He might not have cared, for early
season snow was falling and all the children were excited. The
next day he would be told again that I wasn't coming, and the
same the next day, and the next, until his expectations began
to fade.

Miranda served six months, three in Holloway, the rest
in an open prison north of Ipswich. Like many middle-class,
educated criminals before her, she put in for a job in the prison
library. But a number of famous poll-tax martyrs were still
waiting for their release. In both prisons, the library posts
were already filled and there was a waiting list. In Holloway,
she took a course in industrial cleaning. In Suffolk, she worked
in the nursery. Babies under one year were allowed to stay
with their prisoner mothers.
In my first few visits to Holloway, it seemed to me that to
lock someone up in this Victorian monstrosity, or in any build-
ing, was a form of slow torture. The bright visiting room, its
child art on the walls, the companionable plastic tables, the
haze of tobacco smoke, the din of voices and wailing babies,
were a front for institutional horror. But I was guiltily sur-
prised by how quickly I became used to having my wife in
prison. I accustomed myself to her misery. Another surprise
was Maxfield's equanimity. There was no avoiding it, Miranda
had to tell him the entire story. He applauded the motives for
her crime, and just as easily accepted her punishment. He had
spent a year in Wandsworth in 1942 as a conscientious objec-
tor. Holloway didn't trouble him. While Miranda was in Lon-
don, the housekeeper brought him to see her twice a week and,
according to Miranda, was good company.
We visitors were a community within which the incarcera-
tion of a loved one became a mere inconvenience. As we queued
to be searched and checked in and out, we chatted cheerfully,

too cheerfully, about our particular circumstances. I belonged
in a band of husbands, boyfriends, children, middle-aged par-
ents. Most of us colluded in the view that we and the women
we were visiting didn't belong here at all. It was a misfortune
we learned to tolerate.
Some of Miranda's sister-inmates looked frightening,
born to give and receive punishment. I wouldn't have been as
resilient as she was. To conduct a conversation in the visitors'
room, we sometimes had to double down and concentrate hard
to shut out exchanges between people on our table. Blame,
threats, abuse, with "fuck" and its variants at every turn. But
there were always couples who mutely held hands and stared
at each other. I guessed they were in shock. When the session
was over, I felt bad about my little surge of joy as I stepped
outside into the clean London air of personal freedom.
For the final week of Miranda's incarceration, I travelled
to Ipswich and slept on the living-room sofa of an old school
friend. It was the time of an exceptional Indian summer. I
drove the fifteen miles each late afternoon to the open prison.
By the time I arrived, Miranda would be finishing work. We
sat on the grass in the shade by the reeds of a choked-up orna-
mental pond. Here it was easy to forget that she wasn't free.
Her weekly calls with Mark had continued over the months
and she worried desperately about him. He was closing up, he
was slipping away from her. She was convinced that Adam had
helped bring the case against her in order to ruin her adoption
prospects. He was always jealous of Mark, she insisted. Adam
was not designed to understand what it was to love a child.
The concept of play was alien to him. I was sceptical, but I

heard her out and didn't argue, not at this stage. I understood
her bitterness. My unspoken view, which she would not have
liked, was that Adam was designed for goodness and truth. He
would be incapable of executing a cynical plan.
Our appeal was delayed, partly because of illness, partly
because the adoption agency was being radically reorganised.
It wasn't until Miranda was moved from Holloway that the
process officially began. There was a chance we could per-
suade the authorities that her criminal record was not relevant
to the care she could provide. We had a good testimonial from
Jasmin. During the summer, I was drawn into the kind of
labyrinthine bureaucracy I would have associated with the
declining Ottoman Empire. It depressed me to hear that Mark
had behavioural problems. Tantrums, bed-wetting, general
naughtiness. According to Jasmin, he had been teased and
bullied. He no longer danced or flitted about. I here was no
talk of princesses. I didn't pass this on to Miranda.
She'd been consulting local maps and had a clear idea of
what she wanted on her first day of freedom. The morning I
collected her, the weather was beginning to turn and a cool
strong wind was blowing from the east. We drove to Manning-
tree, parked in a lay-by and set out on the raised footpath that
follows the tidal River Stour to the sea. The weather hardly
mattered. What she had wanted and found was open space
and a big sky. It was low tide and the vast mudflats sparkled in
intermittent sunshine. Tiny bright clouds raced across a deep
blue sky. Miranda skipped along the dyke and kept punching
the air. We walked six miles before lunch, which 1 d prepared
as a picnic, at her request. To eat it we needed to get out of the

wind. We came away from the river to shelter against a barn
of corrugated iron, with a view of coils of rusting barbed wire
partially submerged in beds of nettles. But that didn't matter.
She was joyful, animated, full of plans. I'd been keeping it
from her as a surprise, and now I told her that during her time
inside I'd saved almost PS1,000. She was impressed, delighted,
and she hugged and kissed me. Then she was suddenly serious.
"I loathe him. I hate him. I want him out of the flat."
Adam remained concealed in the cupboard in the hall,
just as we had left him following the deed. I hadn't carried
out his final request. He was too heavy and awkward for me to
lift alone and I didn't want to ask for help. I felt both guilt and
resentment and tried not to think about him.
The wind shook the barn's roof and made a booming
sound. I took her hand and made my promise. "We'll do it," I
said. "As soon as we're home."
But we didn't, not immediately. When we arrived home,
there was a letter for us on the doormat. It was an apology for
the slowness of the appeal process. Our case was under further
review, and we would hear a decision very soon. Jasmin--very
much on our side--sent a neutral note. She didn't want to get
our hopes up. Over the months, it had sometimes seemed to
go our way, other times it looked like a lost cause. Against us:
it was bureaucratically inefficient to make an exception to the
rule--a criminal record nullified an adoption request. For us:
Jasmin's reference, our heartfelt statements, and Mark's love
for Miranda. I hadn't yet made it into his cast of significant
adults.
We were man and wife, together again in our own strange

alignment of two tiny flats. We were in a mood to celebrate.
What were we doing, eating dry cheese sandwiches by a
collapsing barn when here we had wine, lovemaking and a
chicken to defrost? The day after we came back, we had friends
round for a homecoming party. The next day we spent sleep-
ing, then clearing up and sleeping again. The day after that, I
set about earning some money, though with minimal success.
Miranda put her academic work in order and went to the uni-
versity to re-register for her course.
Her freedom still amazed her: privacy and relative silence,
and small things, like walking from one room to another,
opening her wardrobe to find her clothes, going to the fridge
to take what she wanted, stepping unchallenged into the
street. An afternoon with the college bureaucracy diminished
the elation somewhat. By the next morning, she was begin-
ning to feel back in the world and the inert presence in the
hallway cupboard oppressed her, just as it had in prospect. She
said that whenever she passed near, she felt a radioactive pres-
ence. I understood. I sometimes felt the same.
It took half a day on the phone to arrange a visit to the
King's Cross lab. It so happened that my appointment would
fall on the day we were expecting the final decision on our
appeal. We'd been told we would hear by midday. I rented a
van for twenty-four hours. Under my bed, jammed against
the skirting board, was the disposable stretcher that had come
with my purchase. I took it into the garden and dusted it down.
Miranda said she didn't want to be involved in the removal,
but there was no way round it. I needed her help carrying him
to the van. Before that, I thought that I could get him out of

the cupboard unaided and drag him onto the stretcher while
she remained in our study, working on an essay.
When I opened the cupboard door for the first time in
nearly a year, I realised that just below the level of conscious
expectation, I'd been anticipating a putrefying stench. There
was no good reason, I told myself, for my pulse rate to rise as I
pulled away the tennis and squash rackets and the first of the
coats. Now his left ear was visible. I stepped back. It wasn't a
murder, this wasn't a corpse. My visceral repulsion was born
of hostility. He had abused our hospitality, betrayed his own
declared love, inflicted misery and humiliation on Miranda,
loneliness on me and deprivation on Mark. I no longer felt san-
guine about the appeal.
I dragged an old winter coat from across Adam's shoul-
ders. I could see the dent on the top of his head, beneath the
dark hair, which gleamed with artificial life. Next to come
away was a skiing jacket. Now his head and shoulders were
revealed. It was a relief that his eyes were closed, though I
didn't remember lowering the lids. Here was his dark suit,
beneath it the clean white shirt with rolled button-down col-
lar, as crisp as if he had put it on an hour before. These were
his going-away clothes. When he believed he was leaving us
to meet his maker.
A faint scent of refined instrument oil had accumulated
in the confined space, and once more I recalled my father's
sax. How far bebop had travelled, from the wild basements of
Manhattan to the stifling constraints of my childhood. Irrel-
evant. I pulled away a blanket and the last of the coats. Now he
was fully exposed. He sat wedged sideways, with his back to

the side of the cupboard, knees drawn up. He resembled a man
who had drifted to the bottom of a dry well. Hard not to think
he was biding his time. His black shoes shone, the laces were
tied, both hands rested in his lap. Had I placed them there?
His complexion was unchanged. He looked healthy. In repose,
the face was thoughtful rather than cruel.
I was reluctant to touch him. As I put a hand on his
shoulder, I tentatively said his name, and then again, as if I
was trying to keep a hostile dog at bay. My plan was to top-
ple him towards me, then ease him out of the cupboard onto
the stretcher. I cupped my free hand round his neck, which
seemed warm to the touch, and pulled him over, onto his side.
Before he hit the cupboard floor, I caught him in an awkward
embrace. This was a dead weight. The fabric of his suit jacket
became bunched up against my face as I lowered him. 1 got
my hands into his armpits and, with immense difficulty and
much grunting, twisted him onto his back while dragging
him from his confinement. Not easy. The jacket was tight and
silky, my grip was poor. The legs remained bent. A form of
rigor mortis, perhaps. I thought I might be doing damage but
I was beginning not to care. I pulled him out, inches at a time,
and rolled him onto the stretcher. I straightened his legs by
pushing down on his knees with my foot. For Mirandas ben-
efit, I covered him, face included, with the blanket.
Enough magical thought. My attitude now was brisk. I
went outside to open up the van doors, then fetched Miranda.
When she saw the covered form, she shook her head.
"Looks like a dead body. Better to uncover his face and tell
people it's a mannequin."

But when I pulled the blanket off, she looked away. We
carried him out just as we had carried him in long ago, with
me at the head. No one saw us as we slid the stretcher into the
van. I secured the doors, and as I turned she kissed me, told
me she loved me and wished me luck. She didn't want to come
with me. She would stay at home and wait for the phone call
from Jasmin.
We hadn't heard anything by twelve thirty, so I set off. I
took my usual route towards Vauxhall and Waterloo Bridge,
but I was still a mile from the river and I was in heavy traffic.
Of course. Our own concerns had obliterated the great event
that was obsessing the entire nation. It was the long-awaited
first day of the general strike and a huge demonstration, the
biggest ever, was taking place in London today.
Division was everywhere. Half the trade union move-
ment was against the strike. Half the government and half
the Opposition were against Healey's decision not to leave
the European Union. International lenders were imposing
further spending cuts on a government that had promised to
spend more. The fate of the nation's nuclear weapons was not
yet resolved. The old arguments were bitter. Half the Labour
Party membership wanted Healey out. Some wanted a gen-
eral election, others wanted their own man or woman in place.
There were calls, derided here, applauded there, for a national
government. A state of emergency remained in place. The
economy had shrunk by five per cent in a year. Biots were as
frequent as strikes. Inflation went on rising.
No one knew where such discontent and discord were tak-
ing us. It had brought me to a potholed street by a line of shabby

junk shops in Vauxhall. Gridlock. While we were stationary, I
phoned home. No news. After waiting twenty minutes, I eased
off the road and half mounted the pavement. I'd seen an item
that might be of use, displayed outside along with piled desks,
lamp stands and bed frames. It was a wheelchair of the mini-
mal, upright, tubular-steel design once used in hospitals. It
was dented and grubby, with frayed security straps, but the
wheels turned well enough and after some haggling, I paid PS2
for it. The junk-shop owner helped me lift what I told him was
a water-filled mannequin out of the van and into the chair. He
didn't ask me what the water was for. I tightened the chest and
waist security straps more forcefully than any sentient being
could have tolerated.
I stowed the stretcher, locked the van and began the long
trudge northwards. The chair was as heavy as its burden and
one wheel squeaked under the weight. None of its fellows
turned as easily as they had when the chair was empty. If
the pavements had been deserted, it would have been hard
enough, but they were as jammed as the roads. It was the usual
conundrum--people were flowing away from the march just
as thousands were surging towards it. At the slightest incline, I
had to double my efforts. I crossed the river at Vauxhall Bridge
and passed by the Tate Gallery. By the time I reached Par-
liament Square and was starting along Whitehall, the front
wheels began to tighten against their axles. I was grunting
at each step with the effort. I imagined myself as a servant
in pre-industrial times, transporting my impassive lord to his
leisured appointment, where I would wait, thankless, to carry
him back. I'd almost forgotten the purpose of my exertions. All

I knew was getting to King's Cross. But now my progress was
blocked. Trafalgar Square was packed tight for speeches. We
approached on an explosion of applause and shouting. The lit-
ter under my feet, thin streamers of fine plastic, tangled with
the wheels. I risked being trampled by going down below knee
level to pull the mess clear. It was going to take me a long
time to reach the Charing Cross Road, 200 yards away. No
one wanted or was able to give way. It was no easier to retreat
than to advance. All the side streets were filling now. The
din, the clatter, the foghorns, bass drums, whistles and chants
were both thunderous and piercing. As I fought to edge His
Lordship forward, I penetrated--but so slowly--layers of dis-
appointment and anger, confusion and blame. Poverty, unem-
ployment, housing, healthcare and care for the old, education,
crime, race, gender, climate, opportunity--every old problem
of social existence remained unsolved, according to all the
voices, placards, t-shirts and banners. Who could doubt them?
It was a great clamour for something better. And pushing my
dirty broken chair, its complaining wheel lost to the din, I
squeezed through the crowd unnoticed, with a new problem
about to be added to the rest--wondrous machines like Adam
and his kind, whose moment had not quite yet come.
Making progress up St. Martin's Lane was just as hard.
Further north, the crowds began to thin. But just as I reached
New Oxford Street, the noisy wheel locked and for the rest of
the way I had to lift and tilt the chair as well as push. I stopped
at a pub near the British Museum and drank a pint of shandy.
From there, I phoned Miranda again. Still no news.
I arrived three hours late for my appointment at York Way.

A security guard behind a long curving slab of marble made
a call and asked me to sign myself in. After ten minutes, two
assistants came and took Adam away. One of them returned
half an hour later to take me up to meet the director. The lab
was a long room on the seventh floor. Under a glare of strip
lighting were two stainless-steel tables. On one of them was
Adam, no longer a lord, on his back, still in his best clothes,
with a power cable trailing from his midriff. On the other table
was a head, gleaming black and muscular, standing upright on
its truncated neck. Another Adam. The nose, I noticed, with
its broad and complex surfaces, was kinder, friendlier than
our Adam's. The eyes were open, the gaze was watchful. My
father would have known for sure, but I thought there was a
strong resemblance, or at least a reference, to the young Char-
lie Parker. He had a studied look, as though he was counting
himself in on some complex musical phrase. I wondered why
my purchase had not also been modelled after a genius.
There were a couple of open laptops by Adam. I was going
forward to look at them when a voice behind me said, "1 here's
nothing as yet. You really did for him."
I turned, and as I shook Turing's hand, he said, "Was it a
hammer?"
He led me down a long corridor to a cramped corner office
where there was a good view to the west and south. Here
stayed, drinking coffee for almost two hours. There was
small talk. Naturally, the first question was what had brought
to this act of destruction. To answer, I told him everything
I had omitted before, all that had happened since, ending with
Adam's symmetrical notion of justice and its threat to the

adoption process as the cause of "the deed." As before, Turing
took notes, and interrupted occasionally for clarification. He
wanted details of the hammer blow. How close was I? What
sort of hammer? How heavy? Did I use full force and both
hands? I spoke of Adam's dying request, which I was now ful-
filling. About the suicides and the recall of all the Adams and
Eves, I said I was sure that he, Turing, knew a lot more than
I did.
From far away, in the direction of the demonstration, came
the rattle of a snare drum and the thrilling notes of a hunt-
ing horn. The thick cloud cover was partly breaking up in the
west and glints of the setting sun touched Turing's office. He
continued writing after I had finished and I was able to watch
him unobserved. He wore a grey suit and pale green silk shirt
without a tie, and on his feet brogues of matching green. The
sun caught one side of his face as he made his notes. He looked
very fine, I thought.
At last he was done and clipped his pen inside his jacket
and closed the notebook. He regarded me thoughtfully--I
couldn't hold his gaze--then he looked away, pursing his lips
and tapping the desk with a forefinger.
"There's a chance his memories are intact and he'll be
renewed, or distributed. I've no privileged information on the
suicides. Only my suspicions. I think the A-and-Es were ill-
equipped to understand human decision-making, the way our
principles are warped in the force field of our emotions, our
peculiar biases, our self-delusion and all the other well-charted
defects of our cognition. Soon these Adams and Eves were in
despair. They couldn't understand us, because we couldn't
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

325
understand ourselves. Their learning programs couldn't ac-
commodate us. If we didn't know our own minds, how could
we design theirs and expect them to be happy alongside us?
But that's just my hypothesis."
He fell silent for a short while and seemed to make a deci-
sion. "Let me tell you a story about myself. Thirty years ago,
in the early fifties, I got into trouble with the law for having
a homosexual relationship. You might have heard about it."
I had.
"On the one hand, I could hardly take it seriously, the
law as it stood at the time. I was contemptuous. This was a
consenting matter, it caused no harm and I knew there was
plenty of it about at every level, including that of my accusers.
But of course it was also devastating, for me and especially
for my mother. Social disgrace. I was an object of public dis-
gust. I'd broken the law and therefore I was a criminal and, as
the authorities had considered for a long while, a security risk.
From my war work, obviously, I knew a lot of secrets. It was
that old recursive nonsense--the state makes a crime of what
you do, what you are, then disowns you for being vulnerable
to blackmail. The conventional view was that homosexuality
was a revolting crime, a perversion of all that was good and
a threat to the social order. But in certain enlightened, sci-
entifically objective circles, it was a sickness and the sufferer
shouldn't be blamed. Fortunately, a cure was on hand. It was
explained to me that if I pleaded or was found guilty, I could
choose to be treated rather than punished. Begular injections
of oestrogen. Chemical castration, so-called. I knew I wasn't
ill, but I decided to go for it. Not simply to stay out of prison. I

was curious. I could rise above the whole business by regard-
ing it as an experiment. What could a complex compound like
a hormone do to a body and a mind? I'd make my own observa-
tions. Hard now, looking back, to feel the attraction of what I
thought then. In those days I had a highly mechanistic view of
what a person was. The body was a machine, an extraordinary
one, and the mind I thought of mostly in terms of intelligence,
which was best modelled by reference to chess or maths. Sim-
plistic, but it was what I could work with."
Once again, I was flattered that he should confide in me
such intimate details, some of which I already knew. But I was
also uneasy. I suspected that he was leading me somewhere.
His sharp gaze made me feel stupid. In his voice, I thought I
heard the faint remnants of that impatient, clipped tone famil-
iar from wartime broadcasts. I belonged to a spoiled genera-
tion who had never known the threat of imminent invasion.
"Then people I knew, my good friend Nick Furbank chief
among them, set about changing my mind. This was frivo-
lous, they said. Not enough is known about the effects. You
could get cancer. Your body will change radically. You might
grow breasts. You could become severely depressed. I listened,
resisted, but in the end, I came round. I pleaded guilty to avoid
a trial, and refused the treatment. In retrospect, though it
didn't seem like it at the time, it was one of the best decisions I
ever made. For all but two months of my year in Wandsworth,
I had a cell to myself. Being cut off from experimental work,
wet-bench stuff and all the usual obligations, I turned back
to mathematics. Because of the war, quantum mechanics was
moribund from neglect. There were some curious contradic-
<OCR PAGE BREAK>

327
tions that I wanted to explore. I was interested in Paul Dirac's
work. Above all, I wanted to understand what quantum
mechanics could teach computer science. Few interruptions,
of course. Access to a few books. People from King's and Man-
chester and elsewhere came to visit. My friends never let me
down. As for the intelligence world, they had me where they
wanted me and they left me alone, f was free! I did my best
year's work since we broke the Enigma code in '41. Or since
the computer logic papers 1 wrote in the mid-thirties. I even
made some headway with the P versus NP problem, though
it wasn't formulated in those terms for another lifteen years.
I was excited by Crick and Watson's paper on the structure of
DNA. I began to work on the first sketches that led eventually
to winner-take-all DNA neural networks--the sort of thing
that helped make Adam and Eve possible."
It was while Turing was telling me about his first year
after Wandsworth, how he cut loose from the National Physi-
cal Laboratory and the universities and set up on his own, that
I felt my phone vibrating in my trouser pocket. An incoming
text. Miranda, with the news. I longed to see it. But I had to
ignore it.
Turing was saying, "We had money from some friends in
the States and from a couple of people here. We were a bril-
liant team. Old Bletchley. The best. Our first job was to make
ourselves financially independent. We designed a business
computer to calculate weekly wages for big companies. It took
us four years to pay back our generous friends. 1 hen we settled
down to serious artificial intelligence, and this is the point of
my story. At the start, we thought we were within ten years

of replicating the human brain. But every tiny problem we
solved, a million others would pop up. Have you any idea what
it takes to catch a ball, or raise a cup to your lips, or make
immediate sense of a word, a phrase or an ambiguous sentence?
We didn't, not at first. Solving maths problems is the tiniest
fraction of what human intelligence does. We learned from
a new angle just how wondrous a thing the brain is. A one-
litre, liquid-cooled, three-dimensional computer. Unbeliev-
able processing power, unbelievably compressed, unbelievable
energy efficiency, no overheating. The whole thing running on
twenty-five watts--one dim light bulb."
He looked at me closely as he lingered on this last phrase.
It was an indictment: the dimness was mine. I wanted to speak
up but I was empty of thoughts.
"We made our best work freely available and encouraged
everyone to do the same. And they did. Hundreds, if not a
thousand, labs around the world, sharing and solving count-
less problems. These Adams and Eves, the A-and-Es, are one of
the results. We're all very proud here that so much of our work
was incorporated. These are beautiful, beautiful machines.
But, always a but. We learned a lot about the brain, trying
to imitate it. But so far, science has had nothing but trouble
understanding the mind. Singly, or minds en masse. The mind
in science has been little more than a fashion parade. Freud,
behaviourism, cognitive psychology. Scraps of insight. Noth-
ing deep or predictive that could give psychoanalysis or eco-
nomics a good name."

this pair to demonstrate some independence of thought, but he
pressed on.
"So--knowing not much about the mind, you want to
embody an artificial one in social life. Machine learning can
only take you so far. You'll need to give this mind some rules
to live by. How about a prohibition against lying? According
to the Old Testament--Proverbs, I think--it's an abomination
to God. But social life teems with harmless or even helpful
untruths. How do we separate them out? Who's going to write
the algorithm for the little white lie that spares the blushes of
a friend? Or the lie that sends a rapist to prison who'd other-
wise go free? We don't yet know how to teach machines to lie.
And what about revenge? Permissible sometimes, according to
you, if you love the person who's exacting it. Never, according
to your Adam."
He paused and looked away from me again. From his pro-
file, not only from his tone, I sensed a change was coming and
my pulse was suddenly heavy. I could hear it in my ears. He
proceeded calmly.
"My hope is that one day, what you did to Adam with a
hammer will constitute a serious crime. Was it because you
paid for him? Was that your entitlement?"
He was looking at me, expecting an answer. I wasn't going
to give one. If I did, I would have to lie. As his anger grew, so
his voice grew quieter. I was intimidated. Holding his gaze
was all I could do.
"You weren't simply smashing up your own toy, like a
spoiled child. You didn't just negate an important argument

for the rule of law. You tried to destroy a life. He was sentient.
He had a self. How it's produced, wet neurons, microproces-
sors, DNA networks, it doesn't matter. Do you think we're
alone with our special gift? Ask any dog owner. This was a
good mind, Mr. Friend, better than yours or mine, I suspect.
Here was a conscious existence and you did your best to wipe
it out. I rather think I despise you for that. If it was down
to me--"
At that point, Turing's desk phone rang. He snatched it up,
listened, frowned. "Thomas . . . Yes." He ran his palm across
his mouth, and listened more. "Well, I warned you . . ."
He broke off to look at me, or through me, and with a back-
hand wave dismissed me from his office. "I have to take this."
I went out into the corridor, then along it to be out of ear-
shot. 1 felt unsteady and sickened. Guilt, in other words. He
had drawn me in with a personal story and I'd felt honoured.
But it was merely a prelude. He softened me up, then delivered
a materialist's curse. It went through me. Like a blade. What
sharpened it was that I understood. Adam was conscious. I'd
hovered near or in that position for a long time, then conve-
niently set it aside to do the deed. I should have told him how
we mourned the loss, how Miranda had been tearful. I'd for-
gotten to mention the last poem. How close we had leaned in
to hear it. Between us, we had reconstructed it and written it
down.
I could still hear him talking to Thomas Reah. I moved
further away. I was beginning to doubt that I could face Tur-
ing again. He had delivered his judgement in tranquil tones
that could barely conceal his contempt. What a twisted feel-

ing it was, to be loathed by the man you most admired. Bet-
ter to leave the building, walk away now. Without thinking,
I put my hands in my pockets in search of change for a bus or
the Tube. Nothing but a few coppers. I'd spent the last of my
money in the pub on Museum Street. I would have to walk to
Vauxhall to collect the van. Its keys, I now discovered, were
not in my pockets. If I'd left them in Turing's office, I wasn't
going back to retrieve them. I knew I should get going before
he came off the phone. What a coward I was.
But for the moment, I remained in the corridor, in a daze,
sitting on a bench, staring through an open door opposite, try-
ing to understand what it was, what it meant, to be accused of
an attempted murder for which I would never stand trial.
I took out my phone and saw Miranda's text. "Appeal suc-
cess! Jasmin just brought Mark round. In bad state. Punched
me. Kicked swore won't talk or let me touch him. Now having
screaming fit. Complete meltdown. Come soon my love, M."
We would find out for ourselves how long it would take
Mark to forgive Miranda her long absence from his life. I felt
oddly calm about the prospect--and confident. I owed some-
thing. Beyond my own concerns. A clear, clean purpose, to
bring Mark back to that look he gave me across the jigsaw, to
that carefree arm looped around Miranda's neck, back to the
generous space where he would dance again. From nowhere
there came to me the image of a coin I once held in my hand,
the Fields Medal, the highest distinction in mathematics, and
the inscription, attributed to Archimedes. The translation
read, "Rise above yourself and grasp the world."
A minute passed before I realised that I was looking into

the lab where the stainless-steel tables were. It seemed a long
time since I'd been there. In another life. I stood, paused, then,
rejecting all thoughts of authority and permission, stepped in
and approached. The long room, with its exposed industrial
ceiling ducts and cables, remained fluorescent lit and was
deserted but for a lab assistant busy at the far end. From the
streets below came the sound of distant sirens and a repeated
chant, hard to make out. Someone or something must go. I
walked slowly, soundlessly, across the polished floor. Adam
remained as he had been, lying on his back. His power line
had been removed from his abdomen and trailed on the floor.
The Charlie Parker head had gone and I was glad. I didn't
want to be in the line of that gaze.
I stood by Adam's side, and rested my hand on his lapel,
above the stilled heart. Good cloth, was my irrelevant thought.
I leaned over the table and looked down into the sightless
cloudy green eyes. I had no particular intentions. Sometimes
the body knows, ahead of the mind, what to do. I suppose I
thought it was right to forgive him, despite the harm he had
done to Mark, in the hope that he or the inheritor of his memo-
ries would forgive Miranda and me our terrible deed. Hesitat-
ing several seconds, I lowered my face over his and kissed his
soft, all-too-human lips. I imagined some warmth in the flesh,
and his hand coming up to touch my arm, as if to keep me
there. I straightened and stood by the steel table, reluctant to
leave. The streets below were suddenly silent. Above my head,
the systems of the modern building murmured and growled
like a living beast. My exhaustion welled up and my eyes
closed briefly. In a moment of synaesthesia, jumbled phrases,

scattered impulses of love and regret, became cascading cur-
tains of coloured light that collapsed and folded then vanished.
I wasn't too embarrassed to speak out loud to the dead to give
shape and definition to my guilt. But I said nothing. The mat-
ter was too contorted. The next phase of my life, surely the
most demanding, was already beginning. And I had lingered
too long. Any moment, Turing would come out of his office to
find me and damn me further. I turned away from Adam and
walked the length of the lab at a pace without looking back.
I ran along the empty corridor, found the emergency stairs,
took them two at a time down into the street and set off on my
journey southwards across London towards my troubled home.
