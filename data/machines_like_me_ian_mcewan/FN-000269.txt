Machines Like Me

Sally appeared to relax. "Quite a few. The policy is to do
nothing. These are learning machines and our decision was
that if they wanted, they should assert their dignity."
"What about this Adam in Vancouver?" I said. "So dis-
tressed about the destruction of native forest that he down-
graded his own intelligence."
Now the computer engineer was engaged. She spoke
softly through lips that were tight again. "These are the most
advanced machines in the world, years ahead of anything on
the open market. Our competitors are worried. Some of the
worst of them are pushing rumours on the Internet. The sto-
ries are disguised as news, but they're false, it's counterfeit
news. These people know that soon we'll be scaling up produc-
tion and the unit cost will fall. It's a lucrative market already,
but we'll be first with something that's entirely new. The com-
petition is tough, and some of it is utterly shameless."
As she finished, she blushed and I felt for her. She had
ended up saying more than she intended.
But I stood my ground. "The story of the Riyadh suicides
comes from an impeccable source."
She was calm again. "You've kindly heard me out. There's
no point arguing." She made to leave, and stepped around us.
Miranda followed her into the hall to show her out. As the
front door opened, I heard Sally say, "He'll reactivate in two
minutes. He won't know that he's been off."
Adam was awake sooner than that. When Miranda came
back into the room, he was already on his feet. "I should get
to work," he said. "The Fed is likely to raise its rate today.
There'll be fun and games on the exchange markets."
