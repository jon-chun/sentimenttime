elaborated during the forties' Manhattan Project to develop
the first atom bomb. He became famously irritable when he
attempted, overambitiously, to explain PSPACE-complete
mathematics to an impatient television interviewer. Less well
known was his loss of temper on an American cable channel
as he described a problem central to computer science, P versus
NP. He was in front of a combative studio audience of ordinary
"folk." He had recently published his solution, which math-
ematicians around the world were then checking. As a prob-
lem it was easy to state, formidably difficult to resolve. Turing
was trying to suggest that a correct positive solution would
initiate exciting discoveries in biology as well as in concepts of
space and time and creativity. The audience did not share or
understand his excitement. They had only a dim awareness of
his role in the Second World War, or of his influence on their
own computer-dependent lives. They regarded him as the per-
fect English gentleman egghead and enjoyed tormenting him
with stupid questions. The unhappy episode marked the end of
his mission to popularise his field.
Before the confrontation with the nine-dan Japanese go
master, the luring—Hassabis computer played thousands
of matches against itself continuously for a year. It learned
from experience, and it was the scientists' claim—reasonable
enough to have come a step closer to approximating human
general intelligence that gave rise to the legend of machine
intuition. Nothing they said could bring the untethered story
back to earth.
Commentators who suggested that the computer's vic-
tory would make the game extinct were wrong. After his fifth
