Peter Gorringe's confession and my narrative, which includes
all the relevant legal background and case history."
She put her hand, palm downwards, on the package. Her
voice was carefully modulated. "I'm very grateful to you."
I was grateful for her tact. She knew as well as I did, we
needed Adam on our side, online again, working the currency
exchanges. She said, "I'll try to do my very best, if it comes to
court."
He said, kindly, "I'm sure it won't." There was no percepti-
ble change in his tone when he added, "You schemed to entrap
Gorringe. That's a crime. A complete transcript of your story
and the sound file are also in the bundle. If he's to be charged,
you must be too. Symmetry, you see." Then he turned to me.
"No need for judicious edits."
I feigned an appreciative snort of a laugh. This was a joke
of the arm-removal sort.
Into our silence Adam said, "Miranda, his crime is far
greater than yours. Nevertheless. You said he raped you. He
didn't, but he went to prison. You lied to the court."
Another silence. Then she said, "He was never innocent.
You know that."
"He was innocent, as charged, of raping you, which was the
only matter before the court. Perverting the course of justice
is a serious offence. Maximum sentence is life imprisonment.
This was too wild. We both laughed.
Adam watched us and waited. "And there's perjury. Would
you like me to read to you from the Act of 1911?"
Miranda's eyes were closed.
I said, "This is the woman you say you love."
