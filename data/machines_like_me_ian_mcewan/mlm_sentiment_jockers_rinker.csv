463,0.5,his breath was moist and warm.
464,0.75,clever.
465,-0.25,in the user's manual i would read that he urinated once a day in the late morning.
466,0.75,also clever.
467,0.8,"as i went to close his right eye, my forefinger brushed against his eyebrow."
468,-1.55,he flinched and violently jerked his head away from me.
469,-0.6,"startled, i moved back."
470,0.0,then i waited.
471,0.35,"for twenty seconds or more nothing happened, then, with a smooth, soundless movement, infinitesimally slow, the tilt of his shoulders, the angle of his head moved towards their former positions."

481,-0.09999999999999998,"instead, i watched from the great height of a helicopter as the leading ships of the task force rounded portland bill and filed by chesil beach."

483,1.0,how brilliant.
484,0.0,onwards!

496,1.25,"a long lens mounted somewhere on the lizard showed the tiny receding blobs of ships heading bravely out onto the big swell of the open sea to the sound of husky rod stewart, while i tried not to be tearful."
497,-0.5,what turmoil on a weekday afternoon.
498,1.3,"a new kind of being at my dining table, the woman i newly loved six feet above my head, and the country at old-fashioned war."
499,0.25,but i was tolerably disciplined and had promised myself seven hours every day.
500,0.0,i turned off the iv and went to my screen.
501,0.0,waiting for me was the email from miranda that i would hoped for.
502,0.5,i knew i would never get rich.
503,1.5,"the sums i moved around, safely spread across scores of opportunities, were small."
504,-0.7,over the month i had done well out of solid-state batteries but had lost almost as much to rare earth element futures--a foolish leap into the known.
505,0.0,"but i was keeping myself out of a career, an office job."
506,0.0,this was my least bad option in the pursuit of freedom.
507,-0.44999999999999996,"i worked on through the afternoon, resisting the temptation to look in on adam, even though i guessed he would be fully charged by now."
508,0.0,next step was downloading his updates.
509,-1.0,then those problematic personal preferences.
510,1.1,before lunch i would sent miranda an email inviting her to dinner that night.
511,0.8,now she would accepted.

513,0.0,during the meal i would make a proposal.

515,-0.6,"i would not interfere, i would not even want to know what decisions she had made."
516,0.0,she might be influenced by a version of herself:
517,0.75,delightful.
518,0.65,she might conjure the man of her dreams: instructive.
519,0.5,"adam would come into our lives like a real person, with the layered intricacies of his personality revealed only through time, through events, through his dealings with whomever he met."
520,1.1,in a sense he would be like our child.

522,0.5,miranda would be drawn into the adventure.
523,-0.6,"we would be partners, and adam would be our joint concern, our creation."

525,0.0,there was nothing underhand in my plan.
526,0.0,i was sure to see more of her.
527,0.75,we would have fun.
528,-0.5,my schemes generally fell apart.
529,0.0,this was different.
530,-1.5,"i was clear-headed, incapable of deceiving myself."
531,0.0,adam was not my love-rival.
532,0.6,"however he fascinated her, she was also physically repelled by him."
533,0.0,she had told me as much.
534,-0.5,"it was ""creepy,"" she had told me the day before, that his body was warm."
535,-0.25,"she said it was ""a bit weird"" that he could make words with his tongue."
536,0.0,but he had a word-store as large as shakespeare's.
537,1.3,it was his mind that aroused her curiosity.
538,0.0,so the decision not to sell adam was made.
539,1.3,i was to share him with miranda--just as i might have shared a house.
540,0.0,he would contain us.
541,-0.25,"making progress, comparing notes, pooling disappointments."
542,0.75,i regarded myself at thirty-two as an old hand at love.
543,0.75,earnest declarations would drive her away.
544,1.2000000000000002,far better to make this journey together.
545,0.8,"already she was my friend, she sometimes held my hand."
546,0.0,i was not starting from nowhere.
547,-0.75,"deeper feelings could steal up on her, as they had on me."
548,0.0,"if they did not, then at least i would have the consolation of more time with her."
549,0.5,"in my ancient fridge, whose rusty door handle had partly come away, was a corn-fed chicken, a quarter-pound of butter, two lemons and a bunch of fresh tarragon."
550,0.0,in a bowl on the side were a few bulbs of garlic.
551,0.0,"in a cupboard, some earthcaked potatoes, already sprouting--but peeled, they would roast nicely."
552,0.25,"lettuce, a dressing, a hearty bottle of cahors."
553,0.0,simple.
554,0.0,"first, heat the oven."
555,0.0,these ordinary matters filled my thoughts as i stood from my desk.
556,1.9500000000000002,"an old friend of mine, a journalist, once said that paradise on earth was to work all day alone in anticipation of an evening in interesting company."
557,-0.75,the meal i intended to cook for her and the homely dictum of my friend distracted me and for the moment adam was not on my mind.
558,-0.75,"so it was a shock to enter the kitchen and find him standing there, naked, by the table, partly facing away from me, one hand vaguely fiddling with the wire that protruded from his umbilicus."
559,2.05,"his other hand was somewhere near his chin, stroking it in a contemplative way--a clever algorithm no doubt, but entirely convincing in its projection of a thoughtful self."
560,0.0,"i recovered and said, ""adam?"""
561,-0.25,he turned towards me slowly.
562,0.0,"when he was facing me full on, he met my gaze and blinked, and blinked again."
563,0.25,the mechanism was working but seemed too deliberate.
564,0.75,"he said, ""charlie, i am pleased to meet you at last."
565,0.1,"could you bear to arrange my downloads and prepare the various parameters . . ."""
566,0.75,"he paused, looking at me intently, his black flecked eyes scanning my face in quick saccades."
567,0.0,taking me in.
568,0.0,"in my own time."""
569,0.75,his voice surprised and pleased me.
570,1.1,"it was a light tenor, at a decent speed, with a kindly variation in tone, both obliging and friendly, but no hint of subservience."
571,0.75,"the accent was the standard english of an educated man from the middleclass south, with the faintest hint of west country vowels."
572,1.25,"my heart was beating fast, but i was intent on seeming calm."
573,0.0,"to show that i was, i made myself take a step closer."
574,0.0,we stared at each other in silence.
575,1.8,"years before, as a student, i read of a ""first contact"" in the early 1950s between an explorer called leahy and some highlanders of papua new guinea."
576,-0.35,the tribesmen could not tell whether the pale figures who had suddenly appeared on their land were humans or spirits.
577,0.25,"they returned to their village to discuss the matter, leaving a teenage boy behind to spy from a distance."
578,0.0,the question was settled when he reported back that one of leahy's colleagues had gone behind a bush to defecate.
579,0.0,"here, in my kitchen in 1982, not many years later, things were not so simple."
580,1.6,"the manual informed me that adam had an operating system as well as a nature--that is, a human nature--and a personality, the one i hoped miranda would help provide."
581,-0.5,i was unsure how these three substrates overlapped or reacted with each other.
582,0.4,"when i studied anthropology, a universal human nature was thought not to exist."
583,0.25,"it was a romantic illusion, merely the variable product of local conditions."
584,0.6499999999999999,"only anthropologists, who studied other cultures in depth, who knew the beautiful extent of human variety, fully grasped the absurdity of human universals."
585,0.75,"people who stayed behind at home in comfort understood nothing, not even of their own cultures."
586,0.5,"one of my teachers liked to quote kipling--""and"
587,0.0,what should they know of england who only england know?
588,-1.8,"the response from the mainstream of social studies was dismissive, sometimes furious."
589,0.1,"to speak of genes in relation to people's behaviour evoked memories of hitlers third reich, fashions change."
590,0.8,but adam's makers were riding the new wave of evolutionary thinking.
591,-0.25,"he stood before me, perfectly still in the gloom of the winter's afternoon."
592,0.30000000000000004,the debris of the packaging that had protected him was still piled around his feet.
593,0.5,he emerged from it like botticelli's venus rising from her she will.
594,0.75,"through the northfacing window, the diminishing light picked out the outlines of just one half of his form, one side of his noble face."
595,0.09999999999999998,the only sounds were the friendly murmur of the fridge and a muted drone of traffic.
596,0.35,"i had a sense then of his loneliness, settling like a weight around his muscular shoulders."
597,-0.25,"he had woken to find himself in a dingy kitchen, in london sw9 in the late twentieth century, without friends, without a past or any sense of his future."
598,-0.6,he truly was alone.
599,0.0,"all the other adams and eves were spread about the world with their owners, though seven eves were said to be concentrated in riyadh."
600,0.25,"as i reached for the light switch i said, ""how are you feeling?"""
601,0.0,he looked away to consider his reply.
602,0.25,it seemed my question had lowered his spirits.
603,0.25,"but within such microprocessors, what spirits?"
604,0.0,"and--"""
605,0.0,"what else?"""
606,-0.75,"if i pull it out it will hurt."""
607,0.0,but i did not move immediately.
608,0.0,"in full electric light i was able to observe his expression, which barely shifted when he spoke."
609,-0.1,"it was not an artificial face i saw, but the mask of a poker player."
610,0.25,"without the lifeblood of a personality, he had little to express."
611,0.0,he was running on some form of default program that would serve him until the downloads were complete.
612,0.0,"he had movements, phrases, routines that gave him a veneer of plausibility."
613,0.0,"minimally, he knew what to do, but little else."
614,-0.25,like a man with a shocking hangover.
615,-0.9,i could admit it to myself now--i was fearful of him and reluctant to go closer.
616,0.0,"also, i was absorbing the implications of his last word."
617,-0.75,adam only had to behave as though he felt pain
618,0.0,"and i would be obliged to believe him, respond to him as if he did."
619,-0.5,too difficult not to.
620,-0.4,too starkly pitched against the drift of human sympathies.
621,-0.25,"at the same time i could not believe he was capable of being hurt, or of having feelings, or of any sentience at all."
622,0.0,and yet i had asked him how he felt.
623,1.1,"his reply had been appropriate, and so too my offer to bring him clothes."
624,0.0,and i believed none of it.
625,0.0,i was playing a computer game.
626,-0.5,"but a real game, as real as social life, the proof of which was my heart's refusal to settle and the dryness in my mouth."
627,0.5,it was clear he would speak only when spoken to.
628,0.25,"resisting the impulse to reassure him further, i went back into the bedroom and found him some clothes."
629,1.85,"he was a sturdy fellow, a couple of inches shorter than me, but i thought my stuff would fit him well enough."
630,0.0,"trainers, socks, underwear, jeans and sweater."
631,0.0,i stood in front of him and put the bundle into his hands.
632,1.25,i wanted to watch him dress to see if his motor functions were as good as the literature had promised.
633,-0.25,any threeyear-old knows how hard it is to put socks on.
634,-0.3999999999999999,"when i gave him my clothes i caught a faint scent from his upper torso and perhaps his legs too, of warmed oil, the pale, highly refined sort my father had used to lubricate the keys of his sax."
635,-0.5,"adam held the clothes in the crook of both arms, with his hands extended towards me."
636,-0.5,he did not flinch when i stooped and disengaged the power line.
637,0.0,"his tight, chiselled features showed nothing at all."
638,0.0,a forklift truck approaching a pallet would have been as expressive.
639,0.5,"then, i supposed, some logic gate or a network of them yielded and he whispered, ""thank you."
640,-0.25,these words were accompanied by an emphatic nod of the head.
641,1.0,"he sat down, rested the pile on the table, then took from the top the sweater."
642,1.25,"after a reflective pause he unfolded it, laid it flat, chest side down, threaded his right hand and arm through to the shoulder, then the left, and with a complicated muscular swaying shrug it was on him and he was tugging it down straight at the waist."
643,0.8,"the sweater, made of faded yellow fleece, bore in red letters the jokey slogan of a charity i once supported: ""dyslexics of the world untie!"""
644,0.0,he unboxed the socks and remained seated to pull them on.
645,1.0,his movements were deft.
646,-0.5,"no trace of hesitation, no problems with relative spatial calculation."
647,0.8,"he stood, held the boxer shorts low, stepped into them, pulled them up, stepped likewise into the jeans, zipped up the fly and secured the silver button at the waist in one continuous movement."
648,-0.9,"he sat again, hooked his feet into the trainers and tied the laces in a double bow at a blurring speed that to some might have seemed inhuman."
649,0.0,but i did not think it was.
650,2.5,it was a triumph of engineering and software design: a celebration of human ingenuity.
651,0.6,i turned away from him to begin my preparations for dinner.
652,0.0,"overhead, i heard miranda cross the room, her steps muffled, as though barefoot."
653,0.8,"preparing to take a shower, getting ready."
654,0.0,for me.
655,0.0,"i pictured her still wet, in a dressing gown, opening her underwear drawer and wondering."
656,1.4,"silk, yes."
657,0.4,peach?
658,0.25,fine.
659,0.25,"while the oven warmed, i set the ingredients out on the work surface."
660,0.55,"after a day of greedy trading, there is nothing like cooking to bring one back into the world's better side, its long history of catering to others."
661,0.0,i looked over my shoulder.
662,-0.25,"it was startling, the effect of the clothes."
663,0.5,"he sat there, elbows on the table like some old pal of mine, waiting for me to pour the first glass of the evening."
664,0.0,"i called out to him, ""i am roasting a chicken with butter and tarragon."
665,0.8,"without pausing, and in the flattest of tones, he said, i hey go well together."
666,0.4,"but it is easy to burn the leaves when you are browning the bird."""
667,0.0,browning the bird?
668,0.35,"it was correct, i guessed, but it sounded odd."
669,0.0,cover the chicken with tinfoil.
670,0.0,from the size of it i would say seventy minutes at 180.
671,0.0,"i hen pour the tarragon back on with the juices and melted butter."""
672,0.0,"remember to let it stand under a cloth for ten minutes before you carve."""
673,-1.0,did i sound tetchy?
674,0.0,"by the early eighties we were long used to talking to machines, in our cars and homes, to call tres and health clinics."
675,-0.25,but adam had weighed up my chicken from across the room and apologised for the extraneous advice.
676,0.0,then i glanced back at him again.
677,0.35,now i noticed that he would pulled up the sleeves of the sweater to his elbows to expose powerful wrists.
678,0.0,he would interlaced his fingers and was resting his chin on his hands.
679,0.0,and this was him without a personality.
680,0.09999999999999998,"from where i stood, with the light picking out his high cheekbones, he looked tough, the quiet guy at the bar you would prefer not to disturb."
681,0.0,not the sort to hand out cooking tips.
682,-0.75,"i felt the need, rather childish, to demonstrate that i was in charge."
683,0.0,"i said, ""adam, will you walk round the table a couple of times?"
684,0.0,"i want to see how you move."""
685,0.0,there was nothing mechanical about his gait.
686,0.0,in the confines of the room he managed a loping stride.
687,0.0,"when he would been round twice he stood by his chair, waiting."
688,0.0,he came towards me with his open palm extended and i placed the corkscrew on it.
689,0.5,"it was of the articulated, cantilevering kind favoured by sommeliers."
690,-0.5,it gave him no trouble.
691,0.0,"he raised the cork to his nose, then reached into a cupboard for a glass, poured a half-inch and passed it to me."
692,0.0,"as i tasted it, his gaze on me was intent."
693,0.0,"the wine was hardly of the first or even second rank, but it was not corked."
694,0.25,i nodded and he filled the glass and set it down carefully by the stove.
695,0.1,then he returned to his chair as i turned away to prepare a salad.
696,0.75,a peaceful half-hour went by and neither of us spoke.
697,-0.25,i made a dressing for the salad and chopped the potatoes.
698,0.0,miranda was in my thoughts.
699,1.2,i was convinced i would reached one of those momentous points in life where the path into the future forked.
700,0.4,"down one route, life would continue as before, down the other, it would be transformed."
701,3.55,"love, adventures, sheer excitement, but also order in my new maturity, no more wild schemes, a home together, children."
702,-0.25,or these last two were wild schemes.
703,2.75,"hers was the sweetest nature, she was kind, beautiful, amusing, vastly intelligent. . ."
704,0.0,"at a sound behind me, i came back to myself, heard it again and turned."
705,0.0,adam was still in his chair at the kitchen table.
706,0.0,"he had made, then repeated, the sound of a man purposefully clearing his throat."
707,0.0,"miranda."""
708,0.0,i said nothing.
709,-0.75,i was staring angrily into adam's blank face.
710,-1.5,"he said in a quiet sorrowful voice, ""t here's a possibility she is a liar."
711,-1.5,"a systematic, malicious liar."""
712,0.0,"it would take a moment, but she is coming down the stairs."""
713,0.8,his hearing was better than mine.
714,1.0,within seconds there was a gentle tap at the door.
715,0.0,i did notanswer him.
716,-0.5,i was in such a fury.
717,-0.75,i went into the miniature hallway in the wrong frame of mind.
718,-1.0,who or what was this idiot machine?
719,-0.25,why should i tolerate it?
720,2.65,"i wrenched the door open, and there she was in a pretty pale blue dress, smiling merrily at me, a posy of snowdrops in her hand, and she would never looked so lovely."
721,0.75,several weeks passed before miranda was able to work on her share of adam's character.
722,-0.5,her father was ill and she made frequent journeys to salisbury to look after him.
723,0.25,she had a paper to write on nineteenth-century corn law reform and its impact on a single street in a town in herefordshire.
724,0.4,"the academic movement known generally as ""theory"" had taken social history ""by storm""--her phrase."
725,2.8,"since she had studied at a traditional university which offered old-fashioned narrative accounts of the past, she was having to take on a new vocabulary, a new way of thinking."
726,0.75,sometimes as we lay side by side in bed (the evening of the tarragon chicken had been a success)
727,0.0,i listened to her complaints and tried to look and sound sympathetic.
728,0.5,it was no longer proper to assume that anything at all had ever happened in the past.
729,1.0,"there were only historical documents to consider, and changing scholarly approaches to them, and our own shifting relationship to those approaches, all of which were determined by ideological context, by relations to power and wealth, to race, class, gender and sexual orientation."
730,0.25,"none of this seemed so unreasonable to me, or all that interesting."
731,0.0,i did not say so.
732,0.75,i wanted to encourage miranda in everything she did or thought.
733,1.5,love is generous.
734,0.0,"besides, it suited me to think that whatever had once happened was no more than its evidence."
735,0.8,"in the new dispensation, the past weighed less."
736,0.25,i was in the process of remaking myself and eager to forget my own recent history.
737,-0.75,my foolish choices were behind me.
738,0.0,i saw a future with miranda.
739,0.0,"i was approaching the shores of early middle age, and i was taking stock."
740,-3.0,"i lived daily with the accumulated historical evidence my past had bequeathed, evidence i intended to obliterate: my loneliness, relative poverty, poor living quarters and diminished prospects."
741,0.2,where i stood in relation to the means of production and the rest was a blank to me.
742,0.8,"nowhere, i preferred to think."
743,-0.5,was my purchase of adam more proof of failure?
744,0.0,i was not sure.
745,0.0,waking in the small hours--
746,0.44999999999999996,"next to miranda, her place or mine i summoned in the darkness a lever of the sort found by old railway tracks that would shunt adam back to the store and return the money to my account."
747,0.0,by daylight the matter was more diffuse or nuanced.
748,-0.5,"i had not told miranda that adam had spoken against her, and i had not told adam that miranda was to have a hand in his personality--a punishment of sorts."
749,-0.9,"i despised his warning about her, but his mind fascinated me--if a mind was what he had."
750,1.75,"his appearance thuggishly handsome, he could put on his own socks and he was a technical miracle."
751,0.35,he was expensive but this child of the wiring club could not let him go.
752,0.25,"working on the old computer in my bedroom, out of adam's sight, i typed in my own choices."
753,1.5,i decided that answering every other question would be a sufficiently random kind of merging--our home-made genetic shuffling.
754,2.9,"now i had a method and a partner, i relaxed into the process, which began to take on a vaguely erotic quality; we were making a child!"
755,0.8,"because miranda was involved, i was protected from selfreplication."
756,0.75,the genetic metaphor was helpful.
757,-1.0,"scanning the lists of idiotic statements, i more or less chose approximations of myself."
758,0.8,"whether miranda did the same, or something different, we would end up with a third person, a new personality."
759,-1.5,"i was not going to sell adam, but the ""malicious liar"" remark rankled."
760,-0.75,"in studying the manual, i would read about the kill switch."
761,-0.4,"somewhere on the nape of his neck, just below the hairline, was a mole."
762,0.0,"if i were to lay a finger on it for three seconds or so, then increase the pressure, he would be powered down."
763,-0.75,"nothing, no files, memories or skills, would be lost."
764,0.6,"that first afternoon with adam i would been reluctant to touch his neck or any part of him, and held back until late in the day after my successful dinner with miranda."
765,-1.0,i would spent the afternoon at my screen losing ps111.
766,-0.25,"i went into the kitchen where the dishes, pots and pans were piled in the sink."
767,0.8,"as a test of his competence i could have asked adam to clear up, but i was in a strange, elevated state that day."
768,-0.75,"everything to do with miranda glowed, even her nightmare that had woken me in the small hours."
769,0.10000000000000009,"the plate i had put before her, the lucky fork that had been in and out of her mouth, the pale bowed shape where her lips had kissed her wine glass were mine alone to handle and cleanse."
770,0.0,and so i began.
771,0.0,"behind me, adam was in place at the table, gazing towards the window."
772,0.0,i finished and was drying my hands on a tea towel as i went over to him.
773,0.10000000000000009,"despite my sunny mood, i could not forgive his disloyalty."
774,0.0,i did not want to hear what else he had to say.
775,0.25,there were boundaries of ordinary decency he needed to learn--hardly a challenge for his neural networks.
776,-0.19999999999999996,his heuristic shortcomings had encouraged my decision.
777,0.5,"when i had learned more, when miranda had done her share, he could come back into our lives."
778,0.75,"i kept a friendly tone. """
779,0.0,"adam, i am switching you off for a while."""
780,0.0,"his head turned towards me, paused, tilted, then tilted the other way."
781,0.4,it was some designer's notion of how consciousness might manifest itself in movement.
782,-0.5,it would come to irritate me.
783,-0.25,"he said, ""with all respect, i think that is a bad idea."""
784,0.0,"i was thinking about religion and the afterlife."""
785,-0.25,that is enough.
786,0.0,hold still.
787,1.25,"his breath was warm on my arm, which, i supposed, he could snap with ease."
788,0.25,"i he manual quoted in bold isaac asimov's tirelessly reiterated first law of robotics,"
789,0.0,i could not find what i wanted by touch.
790,0.4,"i walked behind adam and there, as described, right on the hairline was the mole."
791,0.0,i put my finger on it.
792,0.0,his eyes remained open.
793,0.0,i fetched a blanket to cover him up.
794,0.5,"in the days that followed this powering-down, two questions preoccupied me: would miranda fall in love with me?"
795,-0.25,and would french-made exocet missiles scupper the british fleet when it came within range of argentinian fighter jets?
796,-1.0,"when i was falling asleep, or in the mornings while i lingered a few seconds in the foggy no-man's-land between dreaming and waking, the questions merged, the air-to-ship missiles became arrows of love."
797,0.050000000000000044,"what was disarming and curious about miranda was the ease that settled round her choices, the way she abandoned herself to the flow of events."
798,1.75,"that evening she came to supper, and after a pleasant two hours eating and drinking, we made love, having closed the bedroom door on adam."
799,0.0,then we talked into the night.
800,-1.15,"just as easily, she could have kissed me on the cheek after the chicken with tarragon and retreated upstairs to her own bed and read a history book before falling asleep."
801,3.85,"what for me was momentous, the immediate, astonishing fulfilment of my hopes, was for her enjoyable and entirely unsurprising, a pleasant extra course after the coffee."
802,1.1,like chocolates.
803,0.75,or a good grappa.
804,2.05,"neither my nakedness nor my tenderness had the effect on her that hers, in all their glorious sweetness, had on me."
805,2.65,"and i was in decent shape-- good muscle tone, full head of dark brown hair--and generous, resourceful, some had been kind enough to say."
806,1.3,i played a decent hand in pillow talk.
807,2.7,"she hardly seemed to notice how well we got along, how one topic, one harmless running joke, one mood tone succeeded another."
808,0.0,my self-esteem allowed that this was how it must have been with everyone she had known.
809,-0.6,i suspected that our first night together barely entered her thoughts the following day.
810,-0.75,"i could hardly complain when the second night followed the pattern of the first, except that she cooked for me and we slept in her bed, and on the third, in mine--and so on."
811,1.9,"for all our carefree physical intimacy, i never spoke about my feelings in case i prompted her to admit she had none of her own."
812,0.65,"i preferred to wait, to let things build"
813,-0.25,there was vanity in this expectation.
814,-1.0,after a week or so there was anxiety.
815,0.75,i would been glad to switch adam off.
816,-0.5,"now i wondered about reactivating him to ask about his warning, his reasons, his sources."
817,0.9,"but i could not let a machine have such a hold over me, which was what would happen if i granted it the role of confidant, counsellor, oracle, in my most private affairs."
818,0.25,i had my pride
819,-1.75,and i believed that miranda was incapable of a malicious lie.
820,0.0,and yet.
821,-1.0,"i despised myself for doing it, but ten days into the affair i began my own investigations."
822,0.5,"apart from the much-discussed notion of ""machine intuition,"" adam's only possible source was the internet."
823,0.0,i trawled through the social media sites.
824,0.0,there were no accounts under her name.
825,0.0,she lived in the reflections of her friends.
826,-0.9,"so there she was, at parties or on holidays, carrying a friend's daughter on her shoulders at a zoo, gum-booted on a farm, linking arms or dancing or romping in the pool with a succession of bare-chested boyfriends, with boisterous crowds of teenage girlfriends, with drunken undergraduates."
827,0.5,all who knew her liked her.
828,0.0,no one on any accessible site had a sinister story.
829,0.25,now and then the chatter endorsed parts of the past
830,0.0,she was recounting in our midnight conversations.
831,0.4,elsewhere her name came up in connection with the one academic paper
832,0.09999999999999998,"she had published--""pannage in swyncombe: the role of the half-wild pig in the household economies of a medieval chilterns village."
833,4.35,"as for the intuitive artificial mind, it was pure urban legend, begun in early 1968 when alan turing and his brilliant young colleague demis hassabis devised software to beat one of the world's great masters of the ancient game of go in five straight games."
834,0.65,everyone in the business knew that such a feat could not be accomplished by number-crunching force.
835,0.5,"the possible moves in go and chess vastly exceed the number of atoms in the observable universe, and go has exponentially more moves than chess."
836,2.45,go masters are unable to explain how they attain their supremacy beyond a profound sense of what feels right for any given situation on the board.
837,0.0,so it was assumed that the computer was doing something similar.
838,0.8,breathless articles in the press announced a new era of humanised software.
839,-0.9,"computers were on the threshold of thinking like us, imitating our often ill-defined reasons for our judgements and choices."
840,0.5,"in a counter-move and in a pioneering spirit of open access, turing and hassabis put their software online."
841,0.8,in media interviews they described the process of machine deep learning and neural networks.
842,-0.65,"turing attempted layman explanations of the monte carlo tree search, an algorithm elaborated during the forties' manhattan project to develop the first atom bomb."
843,-1.0,"he became famously irritable when he attempted, overambitiously, to explain pspace-complete mathematics to an impatient television interviewer."
844,-1.45,"less well known was his loss of temper on an american cable channel as he described a problem central to computer science, p versus np."
845,-0.5,"he was in front of a combative studio audience of ordinary ""folk."""
846,0.5,"he had recently published his solution, which mathematicians around the world were then checking."
847,0.3500000000000001,"as a problem it was easy to state, formidably difficult to resolve."
848,4.4,turing was trying to suggest that a correct positive solution would initiate exciting discoveries in biology as well as in concepts of space and time and creativity.
849,2.5,the audience did not share or understand his excitement.
850,-1.5,"they had only a dim awareness of his role in the second world war, or of his influence on their own computer-dependent lives."
851,1.75,they regarded him as the perfect english gentleman egghead and enjoyed tormenting him with stupid questions.
852,-0.75,the unhappy episode marked the end of his mission to popularise his field.
853,0.0,"before the confrontation with the nine-dan japanese go master, the luring--hassabis computer played thousands of matches against itself continuously for a year."
854,1.15,"it learned from experience, and it was the scientists' claim--reasonable enough to have come a step closer to approximating human general intelligence that gave rise to the legend of machine intuition."
855,0.0,nothing they said could bring the untethered story back to earth.
856,-0.5,commentators who suggested that the computer's victory would make the game extinct were wrong.
857,0.0,"after his fifth defeat, the elderly go master, helped by an assistant, stood slowly, bowed towards the laptop and congratulated it in a trembling voice."
858,-0.75,"he said, ""the mounted horse did not kill athletics."
859,0.75,"we run for joy."""
860,0.8,he was right.
861,1.15,"the game, with its simple rules and boundless complexity, became even more popular."
862,-0.55,"as with the post-war defeat of a chess grandmaster, the triumph of the machine could not diminish the game."
863,2.0,"winning, it was said, was less important than pleasure in the intricacies of the contest."
864,1.1,"but the idea that there was now software that could eerily, accurately ""read"" a situation, or a face, a gesture or the emotional timbre of a remark was never dislodged and partly explained the interest when the adams and eves came on the market."
865,0.0,fifteen years is a long time in computer science.
866,0.5,the processing power and sophistication of my adam was far greater than that of the go computer.

1161,1.1,"as the family crossed the playground, mark turned in my direction and raised an arm, perhaps to maintain his balance, perhaps in farewell."
1162,-1.2999999999999998,"in our side-by-side conversations in bed, often in the early hours, a figure presided whose form was becoming clearer as he hovered before us in the darkness, an unfortunate ghost."

1164,0.25,"i looked him up online and saw his face through time, from early twenties to mid-fifties, evolving from girlishly handsome to appealingly ruined."
1165,0.5,"i read his press, which was not extensive."
1166,0.0,his name meant nothing to me.
1167,0.0,a couple of my friends knew of him but had never read him.
1168,0.0,"a profile, five years old, dismissed him as ""an almostman."""
1169,1.85,"since the phrase described one of my own possible fates, i warmed a little to maxfield blacke, and understood the obvious--that to love the daughter would be to embrace the father."
1170,0.4,"whenever she returned from salisbury, she needed to talk about him."
1171,-0.5,"i learned about his different pains, or agonies, the shifting prognoses, the arrogant, ignorant doctor followed by the kind and brilliant doctor, the chaotic hospital with surprisingly good food, the treatments and medications, the fresh hopes abandoned, then restored."
1172,1.6,"his mind, she found countless ways of saying, remained sharp."
1173,-0.19999999999999996,"it was his body that had turned against him, against itself, with the ferocity of a civil war."
1174,-2.15,how it hurt the daughter to see the writer's tongue disfigured by ugly black spots.
1175,-0.15000000000000002,"how it hurt the father to eat, to swallow, to speak."
1176,0.4,his immune system was letting or taking him down.
1177,0.0,there was more.
1178,0.09999999999999998,"he passed a large kidney stone, as excruciating, miranda believed, as natural childbirth."
1179,-0.75,he broke a hip on the bathroom floor.
1180,-1.0,his skin itched intolerably.
1181,-0.8,now he had gout in the joints of both thumbs.

1184,-0.75,there may have been other afflictions too humiliating to recount.
1185,0.0,the woman he should have asked long ago to be his fourth wife had walked out two years ago.

1187,0.6,"his two sons by another marriage sometimes travelled from london, bringing presents of wine, cheese, biographies, the latest wristwatch computer."

1189,1.4499999999999997,"we were not old enough, miranda and i, to understand fully that a man in his late fifties was still too young to expect or deserve such multiple insults."
1190,-1.75,but his resemblance to job tortured by his pitiless god made it seem blasphemous to do anything but listen to miranda.
1191,0.25,the night after my encounter in the playground stood out.
1192,0.5,"hard to believe of a man in love, but my mind wandered as she talked about him."

1196,0.8,"half listening, i was free to contemplate my life's strange new turns."
1197,0.5,"downstairs, still on the same hard wooden chair, my interesting toy waited under its blanket, its merged personality installed that afternoon while it slept."
1198,0.5,the adventure was about to begin.

1200,-0.8,the imbalance in our feelings for each other would be righted.
1201,2.4499999999999997,"we were simply the embodiment of a pattern in modern manners: acquaintance, followed by sex, then friendship, finally love."
1202,1.1,there was no good reason we should travel this conventional course at the same speed.
1203,0.5,patience was all.
1204,-0.4,"meanwhile, surrounding my islet of hopes was an ocean of national sorrow."
1205,-1.1500000000000001,"with ghastly timing, the junta had raised that day 406 argentine flags in port stanley, one for each of their dead, and staged a military parade along the deserted, sodden main street, while in london, in st. paul's, a commemoration service was held for our 5,000."

1208,3.5,but secular tradition could not provide such familiar verses polished to a gleam by the long-discarded sincerity of previous generations.
1209,0.0,man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live.
1210,-1.7999999999999998,"so the hymns were sung, the impenetrable, echoing readings intoned, the responses returned in ragged unison, while the rest of us mourned at the altars of our tv sets."
1211,-0.8,"unlike miranda, i mourned too."
1212,-1.35,"with a million and a half others i had ""marched"" through central london to protest against the task force."
1213,-1.25,"in fact we crept along, stopping to wait at many bottlenecks."
1214,0.25,"the usual paradox held: the matter was grave, the demonstration joyous."

1218,0.5,"or how effectively parliament, the tabloids, the military and two-thirds of the nation would dismiss us."

1221,0.0,we barely knew each other then.
1222,0.6,"she was in the library, making the final changes to her half-wild-pigs paper."
1223,-0.8999999999999999,"she had unusual ideas about the task force for someone in her twenties, and she distrusted the spirit of what she called a ""self-loving crowd,"" its easy like-mindedness, its stupid high spirits."
1224,0.4,she did not share my aptitude for protest or sentiment.
1225,-0.6,"she was not interested in watching the ships leave, or in what came to be known as the sinking, or the inglorious return and still less the service in st. paul's."
1226,0.0,"where i had talked with friends about nothing else for months and read every opinion on the affair, miranda stayed away."
1227,1.0,"when the ships sank, she was silent."
1228,-0.25,"when the black ribbons appeared, she wore one, but she would not be drawn."
1229,0.0,"as she put it, the whole episode ""stank."""
1230,0.0,"now, as i lay beside her with her hand in mine, the orange streetlights beyond the curtains gave her bedroom the appearance of a stage set."
1231,-0.75,she had taken the last train home and waited for a delayed lube to clapham north.
1232,0.0,it was almost three of the clock.
1233,-1.05,she was describing how maxfield had told her ruefully that the gout in his thumbs was a blessing.
1234,-2.55,the pain was so ferocious and localised that his other complaints had faded.
1235,0.0,i was still holding her hand.

1240,0.0,"she stroked my forearm in a gesture of farewell as she turned on her side, away from me."
1241,0.0,"soon her breathing was regular and deep, and i was left pondering in the monochrome sodium dusk."
1242,0.0,he is coming too.
1243,0.6,"she had assumed joint ownership, just as i would hoped."
1244,0.0,but an encounter between adam and an old-style literary curmudgeon like maxfield blacke was hard to envisage.
1245,-0.75,"i knew from the profile that he still worked in longhand, detested computers, mobile phones, the internet and all the rest."
1246,-1.25,"apparently he did not, in that priggish cliche, ""suffer fools gladly."

1249,2.2,"he had yet to leave the house, yet to test his luck as a plausible being capable of small talk."
1250,1.15,i would already decided to keep him away from my circle of friends until he was a fully adept social creature.
1251,0.25,starting out with maxfield could disable important sub-routines.
1252,-0.15000000000000002,miranda might have been hoping to distract her father and energise his writing.
1253,1.5,"or it was to do with me, somehow in my interests in ways i did not understand."
1254,-1.1,or--i failed to resist this thought--against them?
1255,-0.25,"that was a bad idea, of the kind that comes in the small hours."
1256,-0.9,"like all insomniac brooding, the essence was repetition."
1257,0.4,why should i meet her father in the presence of adam?
1258,-0.25,"of course, it was entirely in my power to insist on keeping him here."
1259,-0.44999999999999996,but i would be denying the wishes of a woman whose father lay dying.
1260,-0.5,was he really dying?
1261,-0.8,was it possible to get gout in your thumb?

1264,1.15,"i lay on my side, seeking a cool corner of the pillow, then on my back with a view of a dappled ceiling that now seemed too close, and yellow rather than orange."
1265,0.0,"i asked myself the same questions, i rephrased them and asked them again."
1266,-1.75,"i knew what i was about to do, but i delayed, preferring to fret, denying the obvious for almost an hour."
1267,-0.25,"then at last i got up, pulled on my jeans and t-shirt, let myself out and went barefoot down the communal stairs to my own flat."
1268,0.5,in the kitchen i did not even pause before pulling the blanket clear.

1281,0.5,"i sat at the table, across from him, and after taking a couple of sips, i said, ""why did you say that i should not trust miranda?"""
1282,0.0,his voice had changed.
1283,-0.25,"it was firmer, more expressive in its varied pitch."
1284,0.0,but the attitude--i needed more time.
1285,0.25,"my immediate, unreliable impression was of an intact presence."
1286,-1.0,"i disguised my irritation and said, ""how significant?"""
1287,1.75,"my father, adept at the harmonic progressions of bebop, was a sincere technophobe."

1289,0.0,i drank my tea and considered.
1290,1.5,"in the colossal array of tree-branching networks that governed adam's decision-making, there would be a strong weighting in favour of reasonableness."
1291,-0.75,"i said, ""i happen to know that the possibility is insignificant, close to zero."""
1292,-0.5,"i am so sorry."""
1293,1.3,"he spoke confidently now, seeming to take pleasure in describing his methods."

1295,0.0,"and the date and place."""
1296,0.15000000000000002,"he broke off and stared at me, bug-eyed in astonishment, as though he was taking in my presence for the first time."

1311,0.0,it took him more than a minute to get himself under control.
1312,0.25,i drank the last of my tea and watched what i knew to be a complex process.
1313,0.5,i understood that personality was not like a

1316,0.0,"his rational impulse to collaborate with me may have pulsed through his neural networks at half the speed of light, but it would not have been suddenly barred at the logic gate of a freshly devised persona."
1317,0.5,"instead, these two elements were entwined at their origins, like the snakes of mercury's caduceus."
1318,0.6,adam saw the world and understood it through the prism of his personality; his personality was at the service of his objectifying reason and its constant updates.
1319,-0.6,"from the beginning of our conversation, it had been simultaneously in his interests to avoid a repetition of an error and to withhold information from me."
1320,0.7,"when the two became incompatible, he became incapacitated and giggled like a child in church."

1325,0.5,adam had fallen silent.
1326,1.3,"his expression, the special material of his face, indistinguishable from skin, relaxed into watchful neutrality."

1411,2.2,"but in adam's personality, miranda and i were well shuffled, and as in humans, his inheritance was thickly overlaid by his capacity to learn."
1412,-0.75,perhaps he had my tendency to pointless theorising.
1413,-0.5,"perhaps he had something of miranda's secretive nature and her self-possession, her taste for solitude."
1414,-1.0,"frequently he withdrew into himself, humming or murmuring ""ah!"""
1415,1.75,then he would pronounce what he took to be an important truth.
1416,-0.75,his interrupted remark about the afterlife was the earliest example.
1417,-1.15,"another was when we were outside, in my tiny fraction of a back garden, marked off by a broken picket fence."
1418,0.25,he was helping to pull up weeds.
1419,0.9500000000000001,"it was just before sunset, the air was still and warm, suffused by an unreal amber light."
1420,0.25,a week had passed since our late-night exchange.
1421,0.9,i had brought him outside because his dexterity was still a matter of interest to me.
1422,0.0,i wanted to watch him handle a hoe and a rake.
1423,0.0,"more generally, my plan was to introduce him to the world beyond the kitchen table."
1424,1.0,we had friendly neighbours on both sides and there was a chance that he could test his small-talk skills.
1425,0.1,"if we were to travel together to salisbury to meet maxfield blacke, i wanted to prepare adam by taking him to some shops, and perhaps a pub."
1426,0.75,"i was sure he could pass off as a person, but he needed to be more at ease, his machine-learning capacities needed stretching."
1427,1.5,i was keen to see how good he was at identifying plants.
1428,0.0,of course he knew everything.
1429,-0.25,"feverfew, wild carrot, camomile."
1430,1.0,"as he worked, he muttered the names, for his own rather than my benefit."
1431,0.0,i saw him put on gardening gloves to pull up nettles.
1432,-0.6,mere mimicry.
1433,1.3,later he straightened and looked with apparent interest towards a spectacular western sky intersected by power and telephone lines and a receding jumble of victorian roofs.
1434,-0.25,"his hands were on his hips and he leaned back, as though his lower back was giving him trouble."
1435,0.75,he took a deep breath to indicate his appreciation of the evening air.
1436,-0.5,"then, out of nowhere, he said, ""from a certain point of view, the only solution to suffering would be the complete extinction of humankind."""
1437,0.8,"yes, this was why he needed to be out and about."
1438,-0.6,buried within his circuitry there was probably a set of sub-routines: sociability/conversation
1439,0.25,but i decided to join in.
1440,-0.75,"utilitarianism can be logically absurd."""
1441,0.0,"he replied, ""obviously!"""
1442,-0.25,in an abrupt manner.
1443,-0.15000000000000002,"i looked at him, surprised, and he turned away from me and bent again to his work."
1444,-0.5,"adam's insights, even when valid, were socially inept."
1445,0.6,"on our first expedition away from home, we walked the 200 yards to our local newsagent, mr. syed."
1446,0.0,we passed a few people in the street and no one gave adam a second glance.
1447,1.0,that was satisfying.
1448,0.0,"over bare skin he was wearing a tight yellow jumper, knitted by my mother in her last year."
1449,0.4,"he had white jeans and canvas loafers, bought for him by miranda."
1450,0.5,she had promised to buy him a complete outfit of his own.
1451,1.4,"with his neat muscular bulge of chest and arms, he could have passed for a personal trainer from the local gym."
1452,0.6,"where the pavement narrowed between a tree and a garden wall, i saw how he stood aside to let a woman with a pushchair through."
1453,-0.050000000000000044,"as we neared the shop he said, somewhat absurdly, ""it is good to get out."""
1454,0.0,simon syed had grown up in a large village thirty miles north of calcutta.
1455,0.5,"his english teacher at his school had been an anglophile, a martinet who had beaten into his pupils a courteous and precise english."
1456,0.0,i had never asked simon how or why he had taken on a christian forename.
1457,0.25,"perhaps a desire to integrate, or the parting insistence of his formidable teacher."
1458,0.0,he had arrived in north clapham from calcutta in his late teens and immediately went to work in his uncle's shop.
1459,0.5,"thirty years later, the uncle had died and the shop passed to the nephew, who still supported his aunt from the proceeds."
1460,1.65,"he also supported a wife and three grown-up children, but he did not like to talk about them."
1461,1.0,"he was a muslim, by culture rather than practice."
1462,0.30000000000000004,"if there was sadness in his life, it was well concealed behind a dignified manner."
1463,2.1,"now in his mid-sixties, he was sleek, bald, very correct, with a small moustache that tawhispered to sharp points."
1464,0.8,"there was an anthropology journal, not available on the internet, that he kept for me."
1465,-0.85,he did not mind when i came in to scan the world's front pages during the task force days.
1466,0.5,he was amused by my taste for low-grade chocolate--those global brands invented between two world wars.
1467,-0.25,"in the mid-afternoons, after hours at my screen, i craved sugar."
1468,0.30000000000000004,"in that strange way by which one reserves intimacies for a mere acquaintance, i had told simon about my new girlfriend."
1469,0.0,"when she and i had been in the shop together, he had seen for himself."
1470,0.0,"now, whenever i came by, his first question was always, ""how are matters proceeding?"""
1471,1.5,"he liked to tell me, on the basis of nothing but kindness, ""it is clear."
1472,-0.25,her fate is you.
1473,-0.25,no dodging it!
1474,0.75,eternal happiness for you both.
1475,-0.25,he was old enough to be my father and wanted for me what had eluded him.
1476,-1.5,"there were no other customers when adam and i entered the cramped shop with its compound scent of newsprint, peanut dust and cheap toiletries."
1477,0.0,simon rose from the wooden chair he sat on behind the till.
1478,-0.19999999999999996,"because i was not alone, he would not be asking the usual question."
1479,0.0,"i made the introduction. """
1480,0.0,simon.
1481,0.8,"my friend adam."""
1482,0.0,simon nodded.
1483,0.8,"adam said, ""hello,"" and smiled."
1484,0.5,i was reassured.
1485,0.75,a good start.
1486,-0.5,"if simon had noticed the strange appearance of adam's eyes, he did not show it."
1487,0.0,"it was a common reaction, i would soon discover."
1488,0.0,people assumed a congenital deformity and politely looked away.
1489,-0.6,simon and i discussed the cricket--three consecutive sixes and a pitch invasion at the india--
1490,0.0,england t20-
1491,1.05,"they would be instantly familiar to him, their commercial histories, market share, nutritional value."
1492,0.0,"but as we chatted, it was obvious he was not looking at tins of peas, or anything at all."
1493,-0.25,his face was frozen.
1494,0.0,he had not moved in two minutes.
1495,-2.1,i worried that something unusual or unpleasant was about to happen.
1496,0.75,simon politely pretended he had not noticed.
1497,0.0,it was possible that adam had put himself in rest mode.
1498,0.0,i made a mental note: he was in need of an appearance of plausibility whenever doing nothing.
1499,-0.5,"his eyes were open, but he failed to blink."
1500,0.0,perhaps i had brought him out into the world too soon.
1501,0.050000000000000044,"simon would be offended that i had tried to pass off adam as a person, a friend."
1502,0.09999999999999998,"it could look like mockery, a tasteless joke."
1503,0.0,i would have betrayed a pleasant acquaintance.
1504,-0.75,the cricket banter began to falter.
1505,0.0,"simon's gaze settled on adam, then returned to me."
1506,0.0,"he said tactfully, ""your anthropos is in."""
1507,0.6,"it was my prompt to go over to the magazines, where adam stood."
1508,2.9,"years ago, simon had cleared his top shelf of soft porn in favour of specialist stuff--literary magazines, academic bulletins of international relations, history, entomology."
1509,0.75,"a fair number of ageing, down-at-heel intellectuals lived in the neighbourhood."
1510,0.0,"as i turned away he added, ""you can get it yourself?"""
1511,0.0,a gentle tease to lower the tension.
1512,0.0,simon was taller and he usually reached up for me.
1513,0.0,a single word brought adam to life.
1514,0.0,"with the faintest whirring sound, which i hoped only i could hear, he turned to address simon in formal terms."
1515,0.0,there is a coincidence.
1516,-0.15000000000000002,i have been giving some thought lately to the mystery of the self.
1517,0.4,some say it is an organic element or process embedded in neural structures.
1518,-0.5,"others insist that it is an illusion, a by-product of our narrative tendencies."""
1519,1.05,"there was a silence, then, stiffening a little, simon said, ""well, sir, which is it?"
1520,0.0,"what have you decided?"""
1521,0.5,i am bound to conclude that i have a very powerful sense of self
1522,0.4,and i am certain that it is real and that neuroscience will describe it fully one day.
1523,0.8,"even when it does, i will not know this self any better than i do now."
1524,-0.75,"but i do have moments of doubt when i wonder whether i am subject to a form of cartesian error."""
1525,-0.25,by this time i had the journal in my hands and was preparing to leave.
1526,0.5,i would like to meet one.
1527,0.0,"do you know any?"""
1528,-0.25,simon was emphatic.
1529,0.25,"no, sir."
1530,0.0,"absolutely, i do not."""
1531,0.6,"i raised a hand in farewell and thanks and, taking adam by his elbow, guided him towards the door."
1532,-0.050000000000000044,"it was a cliche of romantic love, but no less painful for that: the stronger my feelings, the more remote and unattainable miranda appeared."
1533,-0.15000000000000002,"how could i complain when she was attained that very first night, after dinner?"
1534,0.75,we had fun
1535,-0.75,"but i was greedy for more, though i tried not to show it."
1536,0.4,"i wanted her to open up to me, to want me, need me, show some hunger for me, some delight in me."
1537,0.1,"instead, my initial impression held--"
1538,-0.25,she could take me or leave me.
1539,1.95,"everything good that passed between us--sex, food, movies, new plays--was instigated by me."
1540,-0.5,"without me she drifted in silence towards her default condition upstairs, to a book on the corn laws, a bowl of cereal, a cup of weak herbal tea, curled up in an armchair, barefoot and oblivious."
1541,0.0,sometimes she sat for long periods without a book.
1542,-0.65,"if i put my head round her door (we now had keys to each other's places) and said, ""how about an hour of frantic sex?"
1543,0.0,when we were done she would take a shower and return to her chair.
1544,0.0,unless i suggested something else.
1545,0.4,"a glass of wine, a risotto, an almost famous sax player at a stockwell pub."
1546,0.0,ok again.
1547,1.75,"to everything i proposed, indoors or out, she brought the same tranquil readiness."
1548,0.75,happy to hold my hand.
1549,1.0,"but there was something, or many things, i did not understand, or she did not want me to know about."
1550,0.35,"whenever she had a seminar or needed to use the library, she returned from college in the late afternoons."
1551,0.0,once a week she came back later.
1552,0.0,it took me a while to notice that it was always a friday.
1553,0.4,finally she told me that she went to the regent's park mosque for friday prayers.
1554,0.0,that surprised me.
1555,-0.1,"but no, she was not thinking of converting from atheism."
1556,0.0,she had in mind a social-history paper she might write.
1557,0.6,"i was not convinced, but i let it go."
1558,0.9,what we lacked was conversational intimacy.
1559,-0.85,we were closest when we argued about the task force.
1560,0.4,"when we went to a bar, her conversation was general."
1561,1.5,"she was happy with her solitude or with lively chat about public matters, but there was nothing personal in between, except her father's health or his literary career."
1562,2.6,"when i tried to ease us towards the past, perhaps angling in gently with something about myself or a question about her own history, she reached quickly for generalities or an account of the earliest years of her childhood, or an anecdote about someone she knew."
1563,-2.4,"i told her about my idiotic excursion into tax fraud, my experience of court and the tedium of my hours of community service."
1564,0.0,"i would have told her anyway, but the story was my pretext to ask if she herself had ever been in court."
1565,-0.25,the answer was abrupt.
1566,0.0,never!
1567,0.0,and then she changed the subject.
1568,2.0,"i would been in various promising affairs and in love, or almost in love, two or three times before, depending on definitions."
1569,0.8999999999999999,i fancied myself an expert and knew better than to put her under pressure.
1570,0.0,i still thought i might get more out of adam on the salisbury affair.
1571,0.0,"if i did not know her secret, at least she did not know i knew she had one."
1572,0.4,tact was everything.
1573,0.30000000000000004,"i still had not told her that i loved her, or divulged my fantasies about our shared future or even hinted at my frustration."
1574,-0.6,i left her alone with her books or her thoughts whenever it suited her.
1575,1.25,"though the subject was not in the line of my interests, i worked up an acquaintance with the corn laws and developed some ideas of my own about free trade."
1576,0.5,"she did not dismiss them, but nor was she impressed."
1577,0.6,"so here we were upstairs at dinner in her kitchen, which was even smaller than mine."
1578,0.25,"the table was of white moulded plastic, just big enough for two, probably stolen from a pub garden by a previous tenant."
1579,-0.25,"standing at the sink, up to his elbows in suds, adam dealt with the plates and cutlery"
1580,-1.0,"we would handed him at the end of our meal--toad-in-the-hole, baked beans, fried eggs."
1581,0.4,student food.
1582,-1.0,"on the windowsill, where yellow gingham curtains hung still in our late-summer heat wave, a radio was playing the beatles, recently regrouped after twelve years apart."
1583,-2.35,"their album, love and lemons, had been derided for its grandiosity, for failing to resist the lure and overreach of an eighty-strong symphony orchestra."
1584,1.4,"they could not master such forces, was the general drift, with half a lifetime's store of guitar chords."
1585,0.050000000000000044,"nor did we wish to be told again, the times critic complained, that love was all we needed, even if it were true, which it was not."
1586,2.3499999999999996,"but i liked the music's muscular sentimentality, emptied of irony by these middle-aged performers, so confident and tuneful, liberated by useful ignorance of two and a half centuries of symphonic experimentation."
1587,-0.25,"lennon's rasping voice floated towards us from some faraway echoing place beyond the horizon, or the grave."
1588,0.75,i did not mind being told again about love.
1589,0.5,"here before me were all of its warm possibilities, barely three feet away, and it was all i needed."
1590,2.0,"here was her long, exquisitely shaped face (those angled cheekbones might break through the skin one day), the amused gaze, at this point still merry, and narrowed, locked on me, the lips parted, for she was about to speak against what i would just said."
1591,0.9500000000000001,her perfect elongated nose flared faintly at the base of the nostrils' arch to signal in advance her dissent.
1592,-0.75,"her pallor set off her fine brown hair, tonight childishly parted dead centre."
1593,0.6,"against prevailing fashion, she kept out of the sun."
1594,0.4,her bare white arms were also thin and unblemished--not a single freckle.
1595,0.5,"from my point of view we still holidayed in the foothills, among possibilities whose fulfilment rose like distant alps."
1596,-0.75,i tried to ignore them in order to attend to details.
1597,-0.8,"from her perspective, on the other side of this frail table, we may have already reached our highest point."
1598,0.0,"she may have thought she was as close as she ever wanted to be, or could be, to another person."
1599,1.25,love stories like jane austen's used to conclude chastely with preparations for a wedding.
1600,1.25,"now their climax lay on the far side of carnal knowledge, where all of complexity waited."
1601,-1.3,"for now, my business was to conduct a political argument with her without feelings running high, then turning sour, and at the same time stay true to myself and let her do the same."
1602,-0.09999999999999998,"it was a feasible balancing act, as long as i drank less than half a bottle of the indifferent medoc that stood between us."
1603,0.8,"we would had this conversation before and it should have been easier now, but repetition seemed like an indictment of us both."
1604,0.0,we did not really want to be talking about it.
1605,-0.75,"impossible to avoid, even though we knew it would lead nowhere."
1606,0.0,but this was how it was for everyone.
1607,-0.5,we were all still tending the wound.
1608,0.09999999999999998,how could miranda and i spend our lives together when we could not agree on such a fundamental as war?
1609,0.0,about the islands formerly known as the falklands she had firm views.
1610,0.0,she insisted that the argentine flag-planting on remote south georgia had been a clear violation of international law.
1611,-1.75,i said it was an inhospitable place and no one should be asked to fight to the death for it.
1612,-0.9,she said that the taking of port stanley was the desperate act of an unpopular regime looking to whip up patriotic fervour.
1613,0.6,i said this was all the more reason not to get drawn in.
1614,-0.09999999999999998,"she said the task force was a brave and brilliant conception, even in failure."
1615,-1.75,"i said, uneasily remembering my emotional state when the ships set off, that it was a ridiculous enactment of lost imperial grandeur."
1616,-0.5,"how could i not see, she said, that this was an antifascist war?"
1617,-0.75,"no (i spoke over her), it was a row over property, fed on each side by nationalistic stupidity."
1618,-0.8,i summoned the borges observation: two bald men fighting over a comb.
1619,0.0,she replied that a bald man might hand down his comb to his children.
1620,-1.35,"i was struggling to understand this when she added that the generals had tortured, disappeared and killed their citizens by the thousands and were running the economy into the ground."
1621,-0.35,"if we would taken back the islands, the humiliation would have finished the military regime and democracy would have returned to argentina."
1622,0.0,i replied that she could not possibly know this.
1623,-0.6,we had lost thousands of young men and women to the because of mrs. thatcher's ambitions.
1624,0.0,my voice began to rise before i remembered.
1625,-1.75,i resumed quietly but with a certain tremor: that she remained in office after such slaughter was the greatest political scandal of our time.
1626,3.25,"i delivered this with a finality that deserved a moment's respectful silence, but miranda came straight back to tell me that the prime minister failed in a decent because and was supported by almost all of parliament and the country and she was right to remain in office."
1627,0.25,"during this conversation, adam finished with the dishes and stood with his back to the kitchen sink to watch us, arms folded, his head turning from side to side, speaker to speaker, like a spectator at a tennis match."
1628,-0.5,"our exchange was not exactly weary, but repetition had given it an air of ritual."
1629,0.25,"like facing armies, we would taken up our positions and intended to hold them."
1630,-0.35,miranda was telling me that the task force set off without proper ship-to-air missiles.
1631,0.0,the chiefs of staff let the armed forces down.
1632,0.25,"i used to hear terms like these--ship-toair, homing devices, titanium-tipped--at the warwickshire student union bar, but only from men, men of the political left, whose opinions were complicated by tacit admiration for the weapon systems they condemned."
1633,2.5,"in her soft and fluent delivery, she mingled these with other concepts from the lexicon of established power--the open society, rule of law, restoration of democracy."
1634,0.0,perhaps it was her father i was hearing.
1635,0.0,"while she was speaking, i turned to catch adam's expression."
1636,1.05,what i saw was his devoted attention.
1637,0.0,more than that.
1638,1.0,a look of delight.
1639,0.5,he adored what she was saying.
1640,-0.6,"i turned back to miranda as she reminded me that the falklanders were my fellow citizens, now living under fascism."
1641,0.75,was i happy with that?
1642,-1.75,i disliked this rhetorical turn.
1643,-1.0,it was a masked insult.
1644,-0.5,"the conversation was turning sour, just as i would feared, but i could not help myself."
1645,-0.75,"in the tiny kitchen space, i was hot and irritable as i reached for the wine and filled my glass."
1646,0.0,"there could have been a negotiated settlement, i started to say."
1647,0.75,"a slow and painless thirty-year transition, a un mandate, guaranteed rights."
1648,-1.25,she interrupted to inform me that we could never trust any undertaking by the murdering generals.
1649,-0.35,"as she said it, i saw them in caricature, in braided hats, campaign ribbons, cavalry boots, and galtieri on his white horse in a confetti blizzard on the avenida 25 de mayo."
1650,0.8,i said that i accepted every last one of her arguments.
1651,-1.0,"the forces set off on their 8,000-mile mission, her risky strategy was tested and it failed."
1652,-3.15,"thousands she never knew or cared about were drowned or burned to death, or live on, maimed, disfigured, traumatised."
1653,-1.6,we have arrived at the worst outcome: the junta possessed the island and its inhabitants.
1654,-1.75,"whereas a policy of slow, negotiated agreement was not tested, but if it had failed we would have reached the same outcome, without the agony and death."
1655,0.0,we could not know.
1656,-0.75,what might have happened was lost to us.
1657,-0.5,so what was there to argue about?
1658,-0.25,"i saw that the glass i would filled, and had no memory of touching, was empty."
1659,-0.75,and i was wrong.
1660,-0.5,"there was plenty to argue about, for"
1661,0.0,"even as i said it, i knew i was crossing a line."
1662,-2.25,"i had accused her of not caring about the dead, and she was angry."
1663,0.0,"her eyes were narrowed, without merriment, but she did not address my transgression."
1664,0.0,"instead, she turned to adam and asked quietly, ""what is your view?"""
1665,0.0,his gaze travelled from her to me and back.
1666,0.0,i still did not know whether he actually saw anything.
1667,0.0,"an image on some internal screen that no one was watching, or some diffused circuitry to orient his body in three-dimensional space?"
1668,-1.25,"seeming to see could be a blind trick of imitation, a social manoeuvre to fool us into projecting onto him a human quality."
1669,0.5,"but i could not help it: when our eyes briefly met and i looked into the blue irises flecked with spears of black, the moment appeared rich with meaning, with anticipation."
1670,-0.25,"i wanted to know whether he understood, as i did, and as miranda surely did, that the issue here was loyalty."
1671,1.35,"his tone was prompt and calm. """
1672,-0.6,"invasion, success or failure."
1673,0.0,"negotiated settlement, success or failure."
1674,0.0,four outcomes or effects.
1675,0.25,"without benefit of hindsight, we would have to choose which causes to pursue, which to avoid."
1676,0.0,we would be in the realm of bayesian inverse probability.

1679,0.0,"our reference point, our datum, would be an observer of the falklands situation before any decisions were taken."
1680,0.0,certain a priori probability values are ascribed to the four outcomes.
1681,0.9,"as fresh information comes in, we can measure relative changes in probability."
1682,-0.25,but we can not possess an absolute value.

1688,0.0,now it was miranda who reached for the medoc.
1689,-0.75,i was relieved to be no longer the object of her irritation.

1691,0.0,adam turned his head towards me.
1692,-0.25,"as always, too slowly. """
1693,0.0,of course.

1696,0.4,ultimately bayes reflects a state of mind.
1697,0.0,"as does all of common sense."""
1698,1.4,"then nothing was solved, despite this high gloss of rationality."
1699,0.0,miranda and i had different states of mind.
1700,0.8,what was new?
1701,0.5,but we were united against adam in our differences.
1702,0.5,"at least, this was my hope."
1703,3.5000000000000004,"he may have understood the relevant issue after all: he thought i was right about the falklands and, given a degree of programmed intellectual honesty, the best he could offer miranda, to whom he was also loyal, was an appearance of neutrality."
1704,1.8,"but if that was sound, why not accept the mirror possibility, that he believed miranda was right"
1705,1.5,and i was the one in receipt of loyal support?
1706,-0.25,"with a sudden scrape of a kitchen chair, miranda stood."
1707,-1.2000000000000002,there was a faint flush about her face and throat
1708,0.0,and she was not looking at me.
1709,0.0,we would be sleeping in separate beds that night.
1710,-0.55,i would have happily unsaid my entire argument to stay with her.
1711,-0.75,but i was dumb.
1712,0.5,"she said to adam, ""you can stay up here to charge, if you like."""
1713,0.0,adam needed six hours a night connected to a thirteenamp socket.
1714,0.6,"he went into sleep mode and sat quietly ""reading"" until after dawn."
1715,0.0,"usually he was in my kitchen downstairs, but recently miranda had bought a second charging cable."
1716,-0.65,"he murmured his thanks and slowly folded a kitchen towel in half with close attention, hunched over the task, and spread it across the draining board."
1717,0.95,"as she moved towards her bedroom door she shot me a look, a regretful smile that did not part her lips, sent a conciliatory kiss across the space between us and whispered, ""just for tonight."""
1718,0.25,so we were fine.
1719,0.0,"i said, ""of course i know you care about the dead."""
1720,0.0,she nodded and left.
1721,0.5,"adam was sitting down, pulling his shirt clear of his belt to locate the tethering point below his waistline."
1722,0.0,i put a hand on his shoulder and thanked him for clearing up.
1723,0.0,"for me, it was far too early for bed"
1724,0.25,"and it was hot, like a summer evening in marrakech."
1725,0.75,i went downstairs and looked in the fridge for something cool.
1726,0.4,"i remained in the kitchen, in an old leather armchair, with a balloon glass of moldovan white."
1727,0.0,there was much pleasure in following a line of thought without opposition.
1728,0.0,"i was hardly the first to think it, but one could see the history of human self-regard as a series of demotions tending to extinction."
1729,2.05,"once we sat enthroned at the centre of the universe, with sun and planets, the entire observable world, turning around us in an ageless dance of worship."
1730,-0.4,"then, in defiance of the priests, heartless astronomy reduced us to an orbiting planet around the sun, just one among other rocks."
1731,2.2,"but still we stood apart, brilliantly unique, appointed by the creator to be lords of everything that lived."
1732,-0.09999999999999998,"then biology confirmed that we were at one with the rest, sharing common ancestry with bacteria, pansies, trout and sheep."
1733,-0.65,"in the early twentieth century came deeper exile into darkness when the immensity of the universe was revealed and even the sun became one among billions in our galaxy, among billions of galaxies."
1734,1.15,"finally, in consciousness, our last redoubt, we were probably correct to believe that we had more of it than any creature on earth."
1735,0.5,but the mind that had once rebelled against the gods was about to dethrone itself by way of its own fabulous reach.
1736,0.0,"in the compressed version, we would devise a machine a little cleverer than ourselves, then set that machine to invent another that lay beyond our comprehension."
1737,0.0,what need then of us?
1738,0.25,"such hot-air thoughts deserved a second, bigger balloon and i poured it."
1739,1.3,"head propped in my right palm, i approached that ill-lit precinct where self-pity becomes a mellow pleasure."
1740,0.7000000000000002,"i was a special case of the general banishment, though it was not adam"
1741,0.0,i was thinking of.
1742,0.0,he was not cleverer than me.
1743,0.0,not yet.
1744,-1.5,"no, my exile was for one night only and it gave a twist of sweet, bearable agony to a hopeless love."
1745,0.25,"my shirt unbuttoned to the waist, all windows open, the urban romance of getting thoughtfully drunk amid the heat and dust and muted din of north clapham, in a world city."
1746,0.19999999999999996,the imbalance of our affair was heroic.
1747,1.0,i imagined an onlooker's approving gaze from a corner of the room.
1748,0.0,that well-formed figure slumped in his beaten-up chair.
1749,0.5,i rather loved myself.
1750,0.0,someone had to.
1751,1.5,"i rewarded myself with thoughts of her, mid-ecstasy, and considered the impersonal quality of her pleasures."
1752,0.5,"i was only good enough for her, as many men might be."
1753,-1.25,"i refused the obvious, that her distance was the whip that drove my longing."
1754,-0.5,but here was something strange.
1755,-0.4,"three days before, she had asked a mysterious question."
1756,-0.25,"we were mid-embrace, in the conventional position."
1757,0.0,she drew my face towards hers.
1758,0.0,her look was serious.
1759,0.0,"she whispered, ""tell me something."
1760,0.0,"are you real?"""
1761,0.0,i did not reply.
1762,0.0,she turned her head away so that i saw her in profile as her eyes closed
1763,-0.25,and she lost herself once more in a maze of private pleasure.
1764,0.0,"later that night, i asked her about it."
1765,0.0,was i real?
1766,1.9,"meaning did i really love her, or was i honest, or did i fit her needs so exactly that she might have dreamed me up?"
1767,0.0,i crossed the kitchen to pour the last of the wine.
1768,0.85,the broken fridge door handle needed a sharp sideways pull to engage its lock.
1769,-1.5,"as my hand closed round the cold neck of the bottle, i heard a sound, a creak above my head."
1770,0.25,i had lived long enough beneath miranda's feet to know her steps and their precise direction.
1771,0.0,she had moved across her bedroom and was hesitating in the threshold of her kitchen.
1772,-0.25,i heard the murmur of her voice.
1773,0.0,no reply.
1774,0.0,she took another two steps into the room.
1775,-0.5,the next would bring her onto a floorboard that under pressure made a truncated quacking sound.
1776,0.0,"as i waited to hear it, adam spoke."
1777,0.0,he pushed his chair back as he stood.
1778,0.0,if he was to take another step he would need to untether himself.
1779,-0.75,this he must have achieved because it was his tread that landed on the noisy floorboard.
1780,0.0,"that meant they were standing less than a metre apart, but there was no sound until a minute had passed, and now it was footsteps, two sets, moving back towards the bedroom."
1781,-0.75,i left the fridge door open because the sound of it closing would betray me.
1782,0.4,no choice but to shadow them into my bedroom.
1783,0.0,so i went and stood by my desk and listened.
1784,0.55,"i reckoned i was right under her bed when i heard the murmur of her voice, a command."
1785,0.0,"she must have wanted air in the room, for adam's steps tracked across the room towards the victorian bay."
1786,0.0,only one of its three windows opened.
1787,0.0,even that one was hard to shift on a warm or rainy day.
1788,-1.5,"the old wooden frames shrank or expanded, and something was wrong with the counterweight and hardened rope."
1789,0.0,"our age could devise a passable replica of a human mind, but there was no one in our neighbourhood to fix a sash window, though a few had tried."
1790,0.0,"and how was my mind as i stood directly below, in an identical bay, reproduced by the thousands in late-victorian industrial-scale developments?"
1791,0.15000000000000002,they had spilled across the five-acre fields of hedgerow and boundary oaks that adorned the southern limits of london.
1792,0.0,"not good--my mind, that is."
1793,0.0,"embodied, it told all."
1794,1.25,"shivering, moist, especially on the palms, raised pulse, in a state of elated anticipation."
1795,-1.25,"fear, self-doubt, fury."
1796,1.1,"in my bay, old fitted carpet, stained and worn since the mid-fifties, extended right to the skirting boards."
1797,-0.5,"in miranda's, the carpet gave way to bare boards that, two world wars back, must have been polished to a nut-brown gleam."
1798,-0.4,"some poor girl in white apron and mob cap, on all fours, waxed cloth in hand, never could have dreamed of the kind of being who would one day stand in the place where she crouched."
1799,0.9,"i heard him plant his feet on the old wood, i imagined him stooping to grip the window by the metal fixtures on its lower frame and heave upwards with the strength of four young men."
1800,-2.3499999999999996,there was a silence of straining resistance before the entire window shot upwards and hit the top casing with a rifle crack and a shattering of glass.
1801,1.0,my snort of delight could have given me away.
1802,-1.15,no shortage now of marginally cooler air filling the room.
1803,0.75,my glee faded as adam's footsteps returned to where miranda waited by the bed.
1804,0.6,"as he went towards her, it might have been an apology that he muttered."
1805,1.55,"here was the sound of her forgiving him, for her brief sentence was followed by the entwined mezzo and tenor of their laughter."
1806,0.0,"i had trailed after adam and was once more by the bed, six feet under."
1807,0.0,he had the manual skills to undress her
1808,0.0,and he was undressing her now.
1809,0.25,what else would occupy their silence?
1810,0.0,i knew--of course i knew--that her mattress made no sound.
1811,2.0,"futons, with their japanese promise of a clean and simple life of stripped-back clarity, were the fashion then."
1812,-0.09999999999999998,"and i myself felt washed in clarity, senses cleansed as i stood in the dark and waited."
1813,0.75,"i could have run up the stairs and prevented them, burst into the bedroom like the clownish husband in an old seaside postcard."
1814,2.2,"but my situation had a thrilling aspect, not only of subterfuge and discovery, but of originality, of modern precedence, of being the first to be cuckolded by an artefact."
1815,0.75,"i was of my times, riding the breaking crest of the new, ahead of everyone in enacting that drama of displacement so frequently and gloomily predicted."
1816,-0.25,"another element of my passivity: even at this earliest moment, i knew i had brought the whole thing down on myself."
1817,0.0,but that was for later.
1818,-1.0,"for now, despite the horror of betrayal, it was all too interesting"
1819,-1.5,"and i could not stir from my role of eavesdropper, the blind voyeur, humiliated and alert."
1820,0.8500000000000001,"it was my mind's eyes, or my heart's, that watched as adam and miranda lay down on the unyielding embrace of the futon and found the comfortable posture for a clasp of limbs."
1821,0.0,"i watched as she whiswhispered in his ear, but i did not hear the words."
1822,0.0,she had never whiswhispered in my ear at such times.
1823,0.5,i saw him kiss her--longer and deeper than i had ever kissed her.
1824,-0.4,the arms that heaved up the window frame were tightly around her.
1825,1.25,minutes later i almost looked away as he knelt with reverence to pleasure her with his tongue.
1826,2.85,"this was the celebrated tongue, wet and breathily warm, adept at uvulars and labials, that gave his speech its authenticity."
1827,0.0,"i watched, surprised by nothing."
1828,3.1,"he did not fully satisfy my beloved then, as i would have, but left her arching her slender back, eager for him as he arranged himself above her with smooth, slowloris formality, at which point my humiliation was complete."
1829,-0.5,i saw it all in the dark--men would be obsolete.
1830,-0.25,i wanted to persuade myself that adam felt nothing and could only imitate the motions of abandonment.
1831,0.0,that he could never know what we knew.
1832,0.65,but alan turing himself had often said and written in his youth that the moment we could not tell the difference in behaviour between machine and person was when we must confer humanity on the machine.
1833,-1.75,so when the night air was suddenly penetrated by miranda's extended ecstatic scream that tawhispered to a moan and then a stifled sob--all this
1834,-0.8,i actually heard twenty minutes after the shattering of the window
1835,-0.5,i hated him.
1836,0.0,"early the following morning, for the first time in years, i tipped into my coffee a heaped spoon of sugar."
1837,-1.75,"i watched the confined, nut-brown disc of fluid turn, then slow, in its clockwise motion, then lose all purpose in a chaotic swirl."
1838,-0.25,"tempting, but i resisted a metaphor for my own existence."
1839,0.0,i was trying to think
1840,0.0,and it was barely seven thirty.
1841,0.0,soon adam or miranda or both would appear at my door.
1842,0.75,i wanted my thoughts and attitude in coherent form.
1843,-1.2,"after a night of broken sleep, i was depressed as well as angry with myself, and determined not to appear so."
1844,-0.35,"miranda had kept her distance from me and so, by contemporary standards, a night with someone else, even something else, was not quite a betrayal."
1845,1.15,"as for the ethical dimensions of adam's behaviour, here was a history with a curious beginning."
1846,-2.4000000000000004,"it was during the miners' strike of twelve years before that self-driving cars first appeared on experimental sites, mostly disused airfields, where movie set designers had constructed imitation streets, motorway junctions and various hazards."
1847,1.6,"if artificial intelligence was to guide these vehicles safely home, what set of values or priorities should be assumed in the software?"
1848,0.3500000000000001,"fortunately, in moral philosophy there already existed a wellexplored set of dilemmas known in the business as ""the trolley problem."
1849,1.0,the traffic is flowing nicely.
1850,0.0,on the pavement on your side of the road is a group of children.
1851,1.4,"suddenly one of them, a child of eight, runs out across the road, right into your path."
1852,-0.5,there is a fraction of a second to make a decision--either mow the child down or swerve onto the crowded pavement or into the oncoming traffic and collide head on with a truck at a closing speed of eighty miles an hour.
1853,0.15000000000000002,"you are alone, so that is fine, sacrifice or save yourself."
1854,0.6,what if your spouse and your two children are in the car?
1855,0.8,too easy?
1856,1.2,"what if it is your only daughter, or your grandparents, or your pregnant daughter and your son-in-law, both in their midtwenties?"
1857,0.0,now take into account the occupants of the truck.
1858,-0.25,a fraction of a second is more than enough time for a computer to give thorough consideration to all the issues.
1859,0.0,the decision will depend on the priorities ordered by the software.
1860,0.5,"while mounted policemen charged at miners, and manufacturing towns across the country began their long, sad descent in the because of free markets, the subject of robot ethics was born."
1861,0.4,"the international automobile industry consulted philosophers, judges, specialists in medical ethics, game theorists and parliamentary committees."
1862,0.0,"then, in universities and research institutes, the subject expanded on its own."
1863,1.0499999999999998,"long before the hardware was available, professors and their postdocs devised software that conjured our best selves--tolerant, open-minded, considerate, free of all taint of scheming, malice or prejudice."
1864,2.4,"theorists anticipated a refined artificial intelligence, guided by well-designed principles, that would learn by roaming over thousands, millions, of moral dilemmas."
1865,1.65,"such intelligence could teach us how to be, how to be good."
1866,-2.0,"humans were ethically flawed--inconsistent, emotionally labile, prone to biases, to errors in cognition, many of which were selfserving."
1867,2.3,"long before there was even a suitable lightweight battery to power an artificial human, or the elastic material to provide for its face a set of recognisable expressions, the software existed to make it decent and wise."
1868,1.5,"before we had constructed a robot that could bend and tie an old man's shoelace for him, there was hope that our own creations would redeem us."
1869,0.1,"the life of the self-driving car was short, at least in its first manifestation, and its moral qualities were never really put to the test over time."
1870,-0.15000000000000002,nothing proved more vividly the maxim that technology renders civilisation fragile than the great traffic paralyses of the late seventies.
1871,0.6,"by then, autonomous vehicles comprised seventeen per cent of the total."
1872,-0.5,who can forget that roasting rush-hour evening of the manhattan logjam?
1873,0.0,"due to an exceptional solar pulse, many on-board radars failed at once."
1874,-0.4,"streets and avenues, bridges and tunnels were blocked and took days to untangle."
1875,-2.55,"nine months later, the similar ruhr jam in northern europe caused a short economic downturn and prompted conspiracy theories."
1876,-0.25,teenage hackers with a lust for mayhem?
1877,-1.05,"or an aggressive, disordered, faraway nation with advanced hacking skills?"
1878,-0.44999999999999996,"or, my favourite, an unreconstructed automobile maker loathing the hot breath of the new?"
1879,0.19999999999999996,"apart from our too-busy sun, no culprit was ever found."
1880,2.15,the world's religions and great literatures demonstrated clearly that we knew how to be good.
1881,0.8,"we set out our aspirations in poetry, prose and song, and we knew what to do."
1882,0.050000000000000044,"the problem was in the enactment, consistently and en masse."
1883,0.75,what survived the temporary death of the autonomous car was a dream of redemptive robotic virtue.
1884,0.0,"adam and his cohort were its early embodiment, so the user's manual implied."
1885,0.85,he was supposed to be my moral superior.
1886,0.8,i would never meet anyone better.
1887,-2.2,"had he been my friend, he would have been guilty of a cruel and terrible lapse."
1888,-0.5,"the problem was that i had bought him, he was my expensive possession and it was not clear what his obligations to me were, beyond a vaguely assumed helpfulness."
1889,-0.75,what does the slave owe to the owner?
1890,0.0,"also, miranda did not ""belong"" to me."
1891,0.5,this was clear.
1892,-0.25,i could hear her tell me that i had no good because to feel betrayed.
1893,0.0,"but here was this other matter, which she and i had not yet discussed."
1894,0.9,software engineers from the automobile industry may have helped with adam's moral maps.
1895,0.0,but together we had contributed to his personality.
1896,0.0,"i did not know the extent to which it intruded on, or took priority over, his ethics."
1897,0.0,how deep did personality go?
1898,1.1,a perfectly formed moral system should float free of any particular disposition.
1899,0.0,but could it?
1900,-0.65,"confined to a hard drive, moral software was merely the dry equivalent of the brain-in-a-dish thought experiment that once littered philosophical textbooks."
1901,-1.0,"whereas an artificial human had to get down among us, imperfect, fallen us, and rub along."
1902,-0.9,hands assembled in sterile factory conditions must get dirty.
1903,0.19999999999999996,"to exist in the human moral dimension was to own a body, a voice, a pattern of behaviour, memory and desire, experience solid things and feel pain."
1904,0.7500000000000001,a perfectly honest being engaged in such a way with the world might find miranda difficult to resist.
1905,-0.75,"through the night, i would fantasised adam's destruction."
1906,-1.0,i saw my hands tighten around the rope i used to drag him towards the filthy river wandle.
1907,0.0,if only he had not cost me so much.
1908,0.0,now he was costing me more.
1909,-0.6499999999999999,his moment with miranda could not have been a struggle between principle and the pursuit of pleasure.
1910,0.0,his erotic life was a simulacrum.
1911,1.0,he cared for her as a dishwasher cares for its dishes.
1912,1.3,"he, or his sub-routines, preferred her approval to my wrath."
1913,-0.5,"i also blamed miranda, who had ticked half the boxes and settled many intricacies of his nature."
1914,-0.5,"and for setting her on, i blamed myself."
1915,1.2000000000000002,"i would wanted to ""discover"" adam in just the way i might a new friend, and here he was, a self-declared cad."
1916,0.0,i would wanted to bind myself closer to miranda in the process.
1917,0.8,"well, i had been thinking about her all night."
1918,0.75,it was success all round.
1919,0.0,i heard footsteps on the stairs.
1920,0.0,two sets.
1921,1.0,i drew yesterday's newspaper and my cup towards me and prepared to appear casually absorbed.
1922,1.25,i had my dignity to protect.
1923,0.0,miranda's key turned in the lock.
1924,-0.4,"as she preceded adam into the kitchen, i looked up as though reluctant to be drawn away from my reading."
1925,-0.25,i had just learned from the front page that the first permanent artificial heart had been installed in a man called barney clark.
1926,0.0,"it pained me that she seemed different, refreshed, newly arranged."
1927,0.5,it was another warm day.
1928,-0.09999999999999998,she wore a flimsy pleated skirt formed of two layers of white cheesecloth.
1929,0.0,"as she came towards me, the material brushed a line several inches above her bare knees."
1930,1.0,"no socks, canvas plimsolls of the sort we used to wear at school, and a cotton blouse buttoned chastely to the top."
1931,-0.09999999999999998,there was mockery in all this white.
1932,-0.25,"behind the crown of her head was a clasp i would never seen before, an ornament in bright red plastic, showily cheap."
1933,-0.5,"inconceivable, that adam could have slipped out of the house to buy it for her at simon's with coins taken from the papier-mache bowl in the kitchen."
1934,0.7,"but i conceived it, and experienced a hot jolt which i concealed behind a smile."
1935,-0.75,i was not going to appear crushed.
1936,-0.25,adam had partly hidden himself behind her.
1937,-0.4,"now, when she stopped, he was at her side, but he would not look directly at me."
1938,2.5,"miranda, however, appeared cheerful, with the amused pout of someone about to deliver important good news."
1939,0.0,the kitchen table was between us
1940,0.5,"and they stood before me where i sat, like candidates for a job."
1941,0.5,"at any other time i would have stood to embrace her, offered to make her coffee."
1942,0.0,she was a morning addict and liked it strong.
1943,0.0,"instead, i cocked my head, met her gaze and waited."

2280,0.0,i rinsed out a coffee mug
2281,0.4,he took it in two hands but would not be led to the table.
2282,-0.6,"watched by us, he stood alone in the centre of the kitchen, eyes closed, and drank, then set the mug down at his feet."

2284,0.0,marmalade?
2285,0.0,"peanut butter?"""
2286,-0.15000000000000002,"the boy shook his head, as though each offer was an item of sad news."
2287,-0.65,"he took them off the plate and gripped them in his fist and ate them methodically, letting the crusts fall to his feet."
2288,0.75,it was an interesting face.
2289,-0.09999999999999998,"very pale, plump, unblemished skin, green eyes, a bright rosebud of a mouth."
2290,1.1,"the ginger-blond hair was buzz-cut close to the scalp, which gave his long, delicate ears a prominent look."
2291,0.0,adam said.
2292,0.0,mark followed me along the narrow corridor and into the lavatory.
2293,0.8,i lifted the seat and helped him pull his shorts down.
2294,0.0,he had no underwear.
2295,0.5,"he was competent with his aim, and his bladder was capacious, for the tiny stream lasted a while."
2296,0.0,i tried to make conversation while he tinkled away.
2297,0.0,shall we look for a picture book?
2298,0.0,he did not reply.
2299,0.75,"it had been a long time since i would seen a penis so minuscule, so dedicated to one uncomplicated task."
2300,0.0,his defencelessness seemed complete.
2301,0.8500000000000001,"when i helped him wash his hands, he appeared familiar with the routine, but he refused the towel and dodged out into the corridor."
2302,0.75,back in the kitchen it looked cheerful.
2303,1.1,"while miranda and adam cleared up, flamenco music was playing on the radio."
2304,-0.5499999999999998,"the newcomer had delivered us into the mundane as well as the momentous, into unbuttered toast as well as the shock of a rejected existence."
2305,-1.85,"our own scattered concerns--a betrayal, a disputed claim to consciousness, a death threat--were trivial."
2306,1.25,"with the little boy among us it was important to clean up, impose order, and only then reflect."
2307,0.09999999999999998,the scintillating guitar soon gave way to shambolic and frenzied orchestral music.
2308,0.75,i snapped it off and into the momentary bliss of silence that followed
2309,0.0,"adam said, ""one of you should now be in touch with the authorities."""
2310,0.0,she meant no.
2311,0.0,"the mother could be looking for him."""
2312,0.0,he waited for a reply.
2313,1.6,"miranda was sweeping the floor and had made a small heap, which included mark's crusts, by the cooker."
2314,-0.6,now she knelt to gather the detritus into a dustpan.

2316,-0.75,the mother's a wreck.
2317,0.0,"she smacks him."""
2318,0.0,adam continued.
2319,0.8,"he made his points with delicacy, like a lawyer giving unwelcome advice to a client he could not afford to lose."
2320,1.0,mark probably loves her.
2321,0.25,"and from a legal perspective, in the case of a minor, there comes a point when your hospitality shades into wrongdoing."""
2322,0.0,mark had gone to stand by adam's side and held the fabric of his jeans between forefinger and thumb.
2323,0.75,adam lowered his voice for the boy's benefit.
2324,-0.85,"with great force, miranda struck the edge of the tin dustpan against the rim of the pedal dustbin to empty out the sweepings."
2325,0.0,"i was polishing glasses, not minding a rift between my lover and her paramour."
2326,-0.15,the fucking machine was talking sense.
2327,0.0,miranda was driven by something other than sense.
2328,0.0,"perhaps it was beyond adam to understand her, or to interpret the noise she had made with the dustpan."
2329,0.0,"i listened and watched and dried the glasses and placed them on their shelf in the cupboard, where they had not been in a long time."
2330,0.0,adam continued in his cautious manner.
2331,-0.25,the police may already be out looking for him.

2337,0.5,"thank you!"""
2338,-0.75,mark began to cry.
2339,-0.8,"before there was a sound, his rosebud stretched to a downturn."
2340,-2.8,"a prolonged falling moan, as of rebuke, was followed by a clucking sound as his collapsed lungs fought for an intake of breath."
2341,-0.75,the inhalation that preceded his wail was also prolonged.
2342,-0.8,the tears were instant.
2343,0.5,miranda made a comforting sound and put a hand on the boy's arm.
2344,0.8,it was not the right move.
2345,-1.5,the wail rose to a siren shriek.
2346,0.25,"in other circumstances, we might have run from the room to an assembly point."
2347,-1.0,"when adam glanced across at me, i gave a helpless shrug."
2348,0.0,mark surely needed his mother.
2349,-0.65,but adam picked the boy up and settled him on his hip and the crying stopped in seconds.
2350,-0.25,"in the gulping aftermath, the little boy stared glassily out at us through spiked eyelashes from a high position."
2351,1.4,"he announced in a clear voice, free of petulance, ""i want to have a bath."
2352,0.0,"with a boat."""
2353,1.0,he had spoken a whole sentence at last and we were relieved.
2354,0.75,it was an irresistible request.
2355,0.0,"more so with the old boundary markers of class--barf and wiv, and glottal t's."
2356,0.0,we would give him everything he wanted.
2357,0.0,but what boat?
2358,-0.25,a competition was forming for mark's affections.
2359,0.0,she stretched out her arms to gather him up but he shrank from her and pressed his face into adam's chest.
2360,0.6000000000000001,"adam looked rigidly ahead, as she called with face-saving cheeriness, ""let us run the bath,"" and led them out and along the corridor to my unappealing bathroom."
2361,0.0,"seconds later, the rumble of running taps."
2362,0.7000000000000001,"i was surprised to find myself alone, as if i had taken for granted a fifth presence in the room, someone i could turn to now to talk about the morning and its parade of emotions."
2363,-1.5,there were fresh cries of distress from the bathroom.
2364,-1.6,"adam hurried back into the kitchen, seized a cereal packet, lifted out its bag, ripped the box apart, flattened it, and in blurred seconds, using some technique he must have copied from a japanese website, fashioned an origami boat, a barque with a single, billowing mainsail."
2365,-1.25,then he hurried out and the wailing subsided.
2366,0.25,the boat was launched.
2367,-0.15000000000000002,"i sat at the table in a stupor, aware that i should get to my screen and earn some money."
2368,0.0,the month's rent was due and there was less than ps40 in the bank.
2369,0.1,i had shares in a brazilian rare earth mining company and this could be the day to sell.
2370,0.8,but i could not motivate myself.
2371,-0.15000000000000002,"i was subject to occasional depression, relatively mild, certainly not suicidal, and not long episodes so much as passing moments like this, when meaning and purpose and all prospect of pleasure drained away and left me briefly catatonic."
2372,0.0,for minutes on end i could not remember what kept me going.
2373,-1.1,"as i stared at the litter of cups and pot and jug in front of me, i thought it was unlikely"
2374,-0.5,i would ever get out of my wretched little flat.
2375,0.0,"the two boxes i called rooms, the stained ceilings, walls and floors, would contain me to the end."
2376,0.5,"there were a lot like me in the neighbourhood, but thirty or forty years older."
2377,2.0,"i had seen them in simon's shop, reaching for the quality journals from the top shelf."
2378,0.09999999999999998,i noted the men especially and their shabby clothes.
2379,-1.6,"they had swept past some critical junction in their lives many years back--a poor career choice, a bad marriage, the unwritten book, the illness that never went away."
2380,1.05,"now their options were closed, they managed to keep themselves going with some shred of intellectual longing or curiosity."
2381,-0.5,but their boat was sunk.
2382,0.5,"mark walked in, barefoot and wearing what looked like an ankle-length gown."
2383,0.0,it was one of my t-shirts and it had an effect on him.
2384,-0.75,"holding out the cotton material in each hand at his waist, he started to run up and down the kitchen, then in circles, and then made clumsy pirouettes in order to spin his gown out around him."
2385,0.0,the attempts made him stagger.
2386,-0.75,miranda came through the kitchen with his dirty clothes and took them upstairs to her washing machine.
2387,0.0,"her way, perhaps, of keeping him here."
2388,0.5,"i sat with my head in my hands, watching mark, who kept looking in my direction to check that i was impressed by his antics."
2389,-1.5,"but i was distracted, only aware of him because he was the only moving object in the room."
2390,0.75,i gave him no encouragement.
2391,0.0,i was waiting for adam.
2392,0.0,"when he appeared in the doorway i said, ""sit down here."""
2393,0.0,"as he lowered himself onto a chair opposite me there was a muffled click, such as children make when they pull their fingers."
2394,-1.0,a low-level malfunction.
2395,0.0,mark continued to prance about the kitchen.
2396,-0.75,"i said, ""why would this gorringe want to harm miranda?"
2397,0.0,"and do not hold back."""
2398,1.0,i needed to understand this machine.
2399,0.0,there was already one particular feature i would observed.
2400,0.15000000000000002,"whenever adam faced a choice of responses, his face froze for an instant that was fractionally above the horizon of perception."
2401,0.25,"it did so now, barely a shimmer, but i saw it."
2402,0.5,"thousands of possibilities must have been sifted, assigned a value, a utility function and a moral weighting."
2403,-0.75,"he intends to kill her."""
2404,0.35,the manufacturers were wrong to believe that they could impress me with a soulful sigh and the motorised movement of a head as adam looked away.
2405,-0.8,"i still doubted that he could, in any real sense, even look."
2406,-1.25,"he said, ""she accused him of a crime."
2407,-0.75,he denied it.
2408,0.0,the court believed her.
2409,0.0,"others did not."""
2410,0.0,i was about to ask more when adam glanced up.
2411,0.0,i turned in my chair.
2412,0.0,miranda was already in the kitchen
2413,0.0,and she had heard what adam said.
2414,0.4,instantly she began to clap her hands and whoop to the little boy's capers.
2415,0.0,"stepping in his path, she took his hands in hers and they whirled in circles."
2416,0.4,his feet left the ground and he screamed in delight as she spun him round.
2417,0.0,he shouted for more.
2418,0.0,"but now she linked arms with him and showed him how to turn about, ceilidh-style, and stamp on the floor."
2419,-0.5,"he copied her movements, placing his free hand on his hip and waving the other wildly in the air."
2420,0.5,his arm did not extend much above his head.
2421,0.6,"the jig became a reel, then a stumbling waltz."
2422,-0.5,my moment of depression dissolved.
2423,2.1,"watching miranda's supple back bend low to make a partner of a four-year-old, i remembered how i loved her."
2424,0.25,"when mark squealed with pleasure, she imitated him."
2425,0.0,"when she sang out on a high note, he tried to reach for it too."
2426,0.25,"i watched and clapped along, but i was also aware of adam."
2427,0.4,"he was completely still, and still without expression, looking not so much at the dancers as through them."
2428,0.5,"it was his turn to be the cuckold, for he was no longer the boy's best friend."
2429,-0.75,she had stolen him away.
2430,-1.0,adam must have realised that she was punishing him for his indiscretion.
2431,-1.0,a courtroom accusation?
2432,0.0,i had to know more.
2433,0.0,mark's gaze never left miranda's face.
2434,0.6,he was entranced.
2435,0.8,"now she picked him up and cradled him as she danced around the room, singing ""hey diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle."
2436,-0.75,"if so, she may have been wrong."
2437,0.5,adam could imitate and respond to emotions and appear to take pleasure in reasoning.
2438,1.1,he might also have known something of the purposeless beauty of art.
2439,0.0,"she set mark down, took his hands again in hers, this time with arms crossed."
2440,1.85,"they circled stealthily, with undulating, rippling movements as she chanted, to his delight, ""if you go down in the woods today, you are sure of a big surprise . ."
2441,1.2000000000000002,"hours later, i discovered that during this kitchen romp adam was in direct contact with the authorities."
2442,-0.5,"it was not unreasonable of him, but he did it without telling us."
2443,2.1,"and so it was that after the dancing and a glass of iced apple juice in the garden, after the clean clothes had been ironed and put on, and the pink sandals scrubbed under the tap, dried and fitted round the tiny feet, whose nails were freshly trimmed, after the lunch of scrambled eggs and a session of nursery rhymes, there came the ring on the doorbell."
2444,0.35,"two asian women in black headscarves--they could have been mother and daughter--apologetic but professionally firm, had come straight from their department to collect mark."
2445,-0.6,they listened to my story of the swing-park scene and examined the three-word message on a scrap of cardboard.
2446,0.0,they knew the family and asked if they could take the note away.
2447,0.0,"they explained that they would not be returning mark to his mother--not yet, not until after another round of assessments and the decision of a judge."
2448,0.5,their manner was kindly.
2449,0.0,"the more senior woman, whose name was jasmin, stroked mark's head as she talked."
2450,0.4,"throughout the visit, adam sat in silence in the same position at the table."
2451,0.0,i checked on him from time to time.
2452,0.4,our visitors were aware of him and exchanged a curious glance.
2453,0.0,we were in no mood to introduce him.
2454,0.25,"after some administrative formalities, the women nodded at each other and the younger one sighed."
2455,-0.75,the bad moment had arrived.
2456,-0.65,"miranda said nothing when the little boy, screaming to stay with her and clutching a fistful of her hair, was lifted from her arms."
2457,0.0,"as the social workers were leading him out through the front door, miranda turned away abruptly to go upstairs."
2458,-1.25,our troubled little household also shook in the larger tremors of confusion that were running through the land beyond north clapham.
2459,-0.09999999999999998,turmoil was general.

2464,1.5,some said it was encouraging that a mass audience was interested in parliamentary exchanges.
2465,-0.6,one commentator invoked the gladiatorial combats of the late roman republic.
2466,-1.25,the summer was hot and something was coming to the boil.
2467,-4.550000000000001,"apart from the government's unpopularity, much else was rising: unemployment, inflation, strikes, traffic jams, suicide rates, teenage pregnancies, racist incidents, drug addiction, homelessness, rapes, muggings and depression among children."
2468,4.45,"benign elements were rising too: households with indoor lavatories, central heating, phones and broadband; students at school until eighteen, working-class students at university; attendance at classical music concerts, car and home ownership, holidays abroad, museum and zoo visits, takings at bingo halls, salmon in the thames, numbers of tv channels, numbers of women in parliament, charity donations, native tree plantings, paperback book sales, music lessons across all ages and instruments and styles."

2574,0.0,and i could get married in.
2575,1.0,"she murmured, ""please."
2576,0.0,"not that,"" as she uncoupled her arm from mine."
2577,-1.25,i was offended and annoyed at myself.
2578,0.0,she in turn seemed repelled by me.

2593,0.0,she swore me to secrecy.
2594,-0.4,then you demanded to know
2595,0.0,and i had to tell you.
2596,0.0,or start to.
2597,-0.75,she heard me and was angry.
2598,-0.5,"you see the difficulty."""

2620,-0.25,i was playing in a melodrama.
2621,0.75,i took him only half seriously and was rather enjoying this game of stags-at-rut.

2630,-0.4,i do not want to stop.
2631,1.6,"as schopenhauer said about free will, you can choose whatever you desire, but you are not free to choose your desires."

2633,0.0,"ultimately, responsibility for the situation rests with you."
2634,0.0,the situation?
2635,0.6,now it was my turn to lean back from the table.
2636,0.0,i slumped in my chair and for a minute i withdrew into thoughts of myself and miranda.
2637,1.15,i too had no choice in love.
2638,0.8,i thought of the relevant section in the user's handbook.
2639,0.0,"there were pages i had skimmed of tables, one spectrum after another on a scale of one to ten."
2640,0.5,the sort of person i like
2641,0.75,or i adore

2650,0.0,the bucket on the floor was near to overflowing.
2651,-0.25,i picked it up and emptied it into the kitchen sink.

2659,0.0,my knuckles brushed against his skin.
2660,0.8,"as i positioned my forefinger, he turned in his chair and his right hand rose up to encircle my wrist."
2661,-0.8,the grip was ferocious.
2662,-1.75,"as it grew tighter, i dropped to my knees and concentrated on denying him the satisfaction of the slightest murmur of pain, even when i heard something snap."
2663,0.35,adam heard it too and was instantly apologetic.
2664,0.0,"he let go of me. """
2665,-0.75,"charlie, i believe i have broken something."
2666,0.0,i really did not mean to.

2669,1.0,"but please, i do not want you or miranda ever to touch that place again."
2670,-1.2999999999999998,"it was a messy break, a partly displaced scaphoid fracture, and it would take months to heal."
2671,0.0,"hen i got back from the hospital, an hour after lunch, miranda was waiting for me."
2672,0.0,she intercepted me in the hall by her front door.
2673,0.0,we would already been talking on the phone while i waited to be treated
2674,0.0,"and i had a lot more to say, and i had some questions too."

2676,-0.09999999999999998,i relaxed into her concern for me.
2677,0.0,i was encased in plaster from elbow to wrist.
2678,1.9500000000000002,"while we made love, i protected my arm with a pillow."
2679,0.5,we passed into the sublime.
2680,2.55,"at least for a while, she was personal as well as inventive, she was solicitous, and joyous, and so was i."
2681,0.0,it was me
2682,0.0,"she was with,"
2683,0.5,not any capable man.
2684,0.09999999999999998,i did not dare threaten with questions the novel and exalted feelings that passed between us.
2685,-1.25,"i could not bring myself to ask her about peter gorringe, or about what she had told the court, or tell her what i had already discovered about the case while sitting in accident and emergency."
2686,0.5,"i did not ask her whether she knew that adam was ""in love"" with her, or whether she had intended to dispose him to be so."
2687,1.55,i did not want to refer to the coolness between us after i would mentioned marriage in holy trinity church.
2688,1.0,"how could i when at one point she pressed my face between her palms and looked into my eyes and shook her head, as if in wonder?"
2689,1.0,"afterwards, i remained silent on these subjects because i greedily thought that within the half-hour we would be going back to her bed, even though she was pulling away from me again as we drank coffee in her kitchen."
2690,0.75,i was happy to believe that all questions and tensions would be settled later.
2691,0.0,"we talked now in a businesslike way, first about mark."
2692,0.5,we agreed to try to find out what was happening to him.
2693,-0.6,she was concerned about adam.
2694,0.0,she thought i should take him back to the shop for a check-up.
2695,0.4,she still held to her plan for the three of us to drive to salisbury to visit her father.
2696,0.7000000000000001,"i did not say that the prospect of us packed into my small car, spending the entire day covering for adam and being polite to a difficult, dying man, had no appeal."
2697,0.5,i was keen to want whatever she wanted.
2698,0.0,we did not go back to bed.
2699,-0.5,a silence forced its way between us.
2700,0.0,i could see that she was already withdrawing into her private world
2701,0.0,and i did not know what to say.
2702,0.0,"besides, she had a seminar at king's, in the strand."
2703,0.6,i decided to settle my feelings by avoiding adam downstairs and going straight out for a stroll on the common.
2704,0.0,there i walked up and down for two hours.
2705,-0.8,my inaccessible wrist itched as i thought about miranda.
2706,0.95,"i did not know how we had traversed so smoothly from coolness to joy, from suspicion to ecstasy, and from there to an impersonal conversation about arrangements."
2707,1.75,she excited me and i could not understand her.
2708,-0.09999999999999998,perhaps some intelligible part of her had been damaged.
2709,-0.75,i was anxious to dismiss that.
2710,1.5,"it must be that she knew more about love, the deeper processes of love, than i did."
2711,0.20000000000000007,"so she was a force, but not of nature, not even of nurture."
2712,0.25,"more like a psychological arrangement, or a theorem, a hypothesis, a glorious accident, like light falling on water."
2713,-0.75,"was not that of nature, and was not this old hat, men thinking of women as blind forces?"
2714,0.0,"then, might she resemble a counterintuitive euclidean proof?"
2715,0.0,i could not think of one.
2716,1.6,"but after half an hour of fast walking, i thought i would found the mathematical expression for her: her psyche, her desires and motives were inexorable, like prime numbers, simply and unpredictably there."
2717,0.0,"more old hat, dressed as logic."
2718,0.0,i was in knots.
2719,-0.6,"pacing the littered grass, i numbed myself with truisms."
2720,0.0,she is who she is.
2721,0.0,she is herself and that is the end of it!
2722,0.0,she approaches love with caution because she knows how explosive it can be.
2723,3.2,"as for her beauty, at my age, in my state, i was bound to think of it as a moral quality, as its own justification, the badge of her essential goodness, whatever she might actually do."
2724,0.0,and look what she had done--from my waist almost to my knees
2725,1.05,"i still felt the afterglow of the most intense sensual pleasure i had ever known, and everywhere its emotional correlate glowed too."
2726,0.0,"i had done two turns when i stopped in one of the larger, emptier expanses of the common."
2727,1.25,"a good way off, on all sides, the traffic turned about me like planets."
2728,-1.0,"usually it oppressed me to reflect that every car contained a nexus of worries, memories and hopes as vital and complicated as my own."
2729,0.75,today i welcomed and forgave everyone.
2730,0.8,we would all turn out well.
2731,0.25,we were all bound together in our own overlapping but distinct forms of comedy.
2732,-1.0,others might also have a lover living with a death threat.
2733,0.5,but no one else with an arm in a cast had a machine for a love rival.
2734,-0.25,"i headed home, north along the high street, past the burned-out premises of the anglo-argentinian friendship society, past the stinking black heaps of plastic sacks, trebled in height since i was last this way."
2735,0.25,a german company had launched their bipedal dustmen-automata in glasgow.
2736,0.4,public contempt was aroused because each one wore the perpetual grin of a contented worker.
2737,-1.5,"if adam could make an origami boat in seconds, it should not have been much of a stretch to have a drone chuck sacks into the mechanical maw of a garbage truck."
2738,-0.19999999999999996,"but the filth and dust caused failure in the knee and elbow joints, according to the financial times, and the cheaper batteries could not survive an eight-hour shift."
2739,0.4,each device cost five years' wages of a dustman.
2740,0.0,"unlike adam, it had an exoskeleton and weighed 350 pounds."
2741,-0.5,"the automata were falling behind on the work, and on sauchiehall street the bags were piling up."
2742,0.19999999999999996,"in hanover, a robot dustman had stepped backwards into the path of an autonomous electric bus."
2743,-0.75,teething troubles.
2744,0.25,"but in our part of the country, humans were cheaper, and they remained on strike."
2745,-1.6,general outrage had given way to apathy.
2746,0.25,someone said on the radio that the stink was no more remarkable than in calcutta or dar es salaam.
2747,0.8,we could all adapt.
2748,0.0,peter gorringe.
2749,-0.5499999999999999,"once i had the name, it was easy to find the press reports as i waited with my throbbing wrist in casualty."
2750,-1.6,"they dated back three years and, as i would guessed, concerned a rape."
2751,-0.75,"as victim, miranda's name was withheld."
2752,0.050000000000000044,"in broad outline, the case resembled a thousand others: alcohol and a dispute over consent."
2753,0.0,she went one evening to gorringe's bedsit in the centre of town.
2754,0.0,"they knew each other from school, which they had left only months before, but they were not close friends."
2755,-1.6,"that night, alone together, they drank a fair amount and around nine of the clock, after some kissing, which neither side denied, he forced himself on her, according to the prosecution."
2756,-0.5,she tried to fight him off.
2757,0.75,both parties agreed that intercourse took place.
2758,2.8499999999999996,"gorringe's defence, provided through legal aid, argued that she had been a willing partner."
2759,-1.6,"counsel made much of the fact that she had not called out for help during the alleged assault, nor had she left gorringe's place until two hours later, or made any distressed phone calls to police, parents or friends."
2760,-1.25,the prosecution case was that she was in a state of shock.
2761,-0.5,"she had sat on the edge of the bed, half dressed, unable to move or speak."
2762,-0.4,"she left around eleven, went straight home, did not wake her father, lay on her bed crying until she fell asleep."
2763,-0.25,the next morning she went to the local police station.
2764,0.0,it was in gorringe's story that the particulars of this case emerged.
2765,1.55,"he told the court that after they made love, they drank more vodka and lemonade, that the post-coital mood was celebratory."
2766,1.35,"she asked him if he had any objection to her texting her new friend amelia to announce that she and peter were an ""item."""
2767,1.6,within a minute there came a reply in the form of a laughing emoticon making the thumbs-up sign.
2768,0.0,the case for the defence should have been simple.
2769,0.0,but the messages were not on miranda's phone.
2770,-0.75,"amelia had been living in a hostel for problem teenagers, and had gone off backpacking and could not be traced."
2771,-0.25,the phone company in canada would not release their record of texts without a formal approach from the police.
2772,-0.35,but the police had targets to meet for solved rape cases and were keen to see gorringe go down.
2773,-0.8,"they knew, as the jury did not, that he had previous convictions for shoplifting and affray."
2774,0.050000000000000044,"in evidence, miranda was emphatic that she had no friend called amelia and that the story of the text was a fabrication."
2775,0.0,two of miranda's old school friends gave evidence in court that they had never heard mention of this amelia.
2776,-0.29999999999999993,"the prosecution suggested that it was too convenient, a vanishing rootless teenager."
2777,0.8,"if she was on a beach in thailand, and if miranda was her friend, where were the customary teenage photos and messages?"
2778,0.0,where was miranda's original message?
2779,1.0,where was that merry emoticon?
2780,0.0,"deleted by miranda, said the defence."
2781,-1.1,"if the court would suspend proceedings and serve an order on the british subsidiary of the phone company to release its copies of the texts, these disputed versions of a summer evening would be settled."
2782,-2.0,"but the judge, whose manner throughout was impatient, even irritable, was in no mind to let the matter drag on."
2783,0.0,mr. gorringe's defence had already had many months to mount their case.
2784,0.0,a court order should have been sought long ago.
2785,1.15,"memorably, the judge noted that a young woman who took a bottle of vodka to a young man's room should have been aware of the risks."
2786,-0.75,some press reports portrayed gorringe as a guilty sort.
2787,0.0,"he was large, loose-limbed, he lounged in the dock, he did not wear a tie."
2788,0.4,he appeared not to be awed by the judge or his court and its procedures.
2789,0.4,the jury was unanimous in favouring miranda's story over his.
2790,0.0,"later, in his summing-up, the judge did not find the accused a credible witness."
2791,-1.0,but certain sections of the press were sceptical about miranda's story.
2792,-0.75,the judge was criticised for not putting the matter beyond doubt by calling in her text records.
2793,-0.65,"a week later, before sentencing, there were pleas of mitigation."
2794,0.75,the headmaster of their school spoke up for both ex-pupils--hardly helpful.
2795,1.0,"gorringe's mother, who was too scared to be articulate, tried bravely but wept from the witness stand."
2796,0.0,no use at all to her son.
2797,-0.25,he rose for sentencing and was impassive.
2798,0.0,six years.
2799,-0.5,"he shook his head, as the accused often do."
2800,-0.75,"if he behaved himself in prison, he would be gone for half his sentence."
2801,-0.7000000000000001,the jury had confronted a stark choice.
2802,-2.25,"miranda raped and honest, or unmolested and a cruel liar."
2803,0.0,"naturally, i could bear neither."
2804,-0.3999999999999999,"i did not take gorringe's murderous threats as proof of his innocence, as the intentions of a wronged man looking for redress."
2805,-1.75,a guilty man could be furious at his loss of freedom.
2806,-2.5,"if he could threaten to kill, he could surely rape."
2807,-0.8,beyond the either-or was a dangerous middle ground where the half-forgotten student anthropologist in me could free his imagination of all constraint.
2808,1.75,"grant the insidious power of self-persuasion, mix in some hours of carefree teenage drinking and blurred recall, then it would have been possible for miranda to feel genuinely that she would been violated, especially if afterwards there were elements of shame; equally possible for peter gorringe to convince himself he had permission when he desired it so urgently."
2809,-0.44999999999999996,"but in the criminal courts, the sword of justice fell on innocence or guilt, not both at once."
2810,0.5,"the story of the missing texts was particular, inventive, easily verified or disproved."
2811,0.0,"by telling it to the court, gorringe la"
2812,0.0,in mcew
2813,-1.25,a in as rapist may have calculated that he had nothing to lose.
2814,-0.5,a wild fiction
2815,0.0,and he almost got away with it.
2816,0.8,"if he was innocent, if the texts existed, then the system had let him down."
2817,0.0,"either way, it had let itself down."
2818,0.0,his story should have been checked.
2819,-1.0,"on that, i was with the sceptical press."
2820,-1.0,"the blame could lie with an inexperienced legal aid team, too hard-pressed, too sloppy."
2821,0.0,or with policemen greedy for success.
2822,0.0,and certainly with an ill-temwhispered judge.
2823,-0.25,"on my way back from the common, i slowed as i turned into my road."
2824,0.0,now i knew as much as adam.
2825,0.0,i had not spoken to him since the evening before.
2826,-1.5,"after a painful, sleepless night, i had got up early to go to the hospital."
2827,0.0,as i went through the kitchen i had passed close by him.
2828,0.4,"he was sitting at the kitchen table as usual, connected to his power line."
2829,0.35,"his eyes were open and had that tranquil, faraway look whenever he retreated into his circuits."
2830,0.25,"i had hesitated there for a whole minute, wondering what i had got into with my purchase."
2831,-0.5,"he was far more complicated than i would imagined, and so were my own feelings about him."
2832,-2.1,"we had to confront each other, but i was exhausted from two broken nights and needed to get to the hospital."
2833,-1.0499999999999998,"what i wanted now, returning from my walk, was to retreat to my bedroom for a dose of painkillers and a nap."
2834,0.0,but he was standing facing me as i came in.
2835,-1.85,"at the sight of my arm suspended in its sling, he gave a cry of astonishment or horror."
2836,0.0,"he came towards me, arms spread."
2837,-0.5,i am so sorry.
2838,-0.5,so sorry.
2839,-0.75,what a terrible thing i did.
2840,0.0,i honestly did not intend it.
2841,3.75,"will you please, please accept my most sincere apologies."""
2842,0.5,it looked as though he was about to embrace me.
2843,-0.5,"with my free hand, i pushed past--i disliked the too-solid feel and went to the sink."
2844,-0.4,i turned on the tap and bent low to drink deeply.
2845,0.0,"when i turned, he was standing close, no more than three or four feet away."
2846,0.6,the moment of apology had passed.
2847,1.3,i was determined to look relaxed--not so easy with my arm in a sling.
2848,0.8500000000000001,"i put my free hand on my hip and looked into his eyes, into the nursery blue with its little black seeds."
2849,0.0,"i still wondered what it meant, that adam could see, and who or what did the seeing."
2850,-0.4,"a torrent of zeros and ones flashed towards various processors that, in turn, directed a cascade of interpretation towards other centres."
2851,0.0,no mechanistic explanation could help.
2852,1.4,it could not resolve the essential difference between us.
2853,-0.4,"i had little idea of what passed along my own optic nerve, or where it went next, or how these pulses became an encompassing self-evident visual reality, or who was doing my seeing for me."
2854,0.0,only me.
2855,-0.5,"whatever the process was, it had the trick of seeming beyond explanation, of creating and sustaining an illuminated part of the one thing in the world we knew for sure--our own experience."
2856,-0.35,it was hard to believe that adam possessed something like that.
2857,0.8,"easier to believe that he saw in the way a camera does, or the way a microphone is said to listen."
2858,0.0,there was no one there.
2859,-1.55,"of himbut as i looked into his eyes, i began to feel unhinged, uncertain."
2860,0.5,"despite the clean divide between the living and the inanimate, it remained the case that he and i were bound by the same physical laws."
2861,1.7000000000000002,"perhaps biology gave me no special status at all, and it meant little to say that the figure standing before me was not fully alive."
2862,-0.25,"in my fatigue, i felt unmoored, drifting into the oceanic blue and black, moving in two directions at once--towards the uncontrollable future we were making for ourselves where we might finally dissolve our biological identities; at the same time, into the ancient past of an infant universe, where the common inheritance, in diminishing order, was rocks, gases, compounds, elements, forces, energy fields--for both of us, the seeding ground of consciousness in whatever form it took."
2863,0.8,i came out of this reverie with a start.
2864,1.25,"i confronted an immediate and unpleasant situation and was not inclined to accept adam as a brother, or even a very distant cousin, however much stardust we shared."
2865,0.0,i had to stand up to him.
2866,0.0,i started talking.
2867,-0.15000000000000002,i told him how i came by a large sum of money after my mother's death and the sale of her house.
2868,0.0,"how i decided to invest it in a grand experiment, to buy an artificial human, an android, a replicate--i forget which term i used."
2869,0.4,"in his presence, they all sounded like insults."
2870,0.0,i told him exactly how much i paid.
2871,0.5,"then i described for him the afternoon when miranda and i carried him on a stretcher into the house, unpacked him, charged him up, when i tenderly gave him my clothes, and discussed the formation of his personality."
2872,1.0,"as i went along, i was not certain of my purpose, or why i was talking so fast."
2873,0.0,it was only when i got there that i knew what i had to say.
2874,0.5,"my point was this: i had bought him, he was mine, i had decided to share him with miranda, and it would be our decision, and only ours, to decide when to deactivate him."
2875,-0.75,"if he resisted, and especially if he caused injury as he had the night before, then he would have to be returned to the manufacturer for readjustment."
2876,0.75,"i finished by saying that this was miranda's view, as she expressed it earlier this afternoon, just before we made love."
2877,-0.25,"this last intimate detail, for the lowest of reasons, i needed him to know."
2878,-0.75,"throughout, he remained impassive, blinking at irregular intervals, holding my gaze."
2879,0.5,"when i finished, nothing changed for half a minute and i began to think i had gone too fast, or spoken gibberish."
2880,0.0,"suddenly he came to life (to life!), looked down at his feet, then turned and walked a few paces away."
2881,0.0,"he turned again to look at me, drew breath to speak, changed his mind."
2882,-0.25,a hand went up to stroke his chin.
2883,0.4,what a performance.
2884,0.75,perfect.
2885,1.85,i was ready to give him my devoted attention.
2886,1.0,"his tone was of the sweetest, most reasonable kind."
2887,0.4,"we can talk about it in a civilised manner, as you just have."
2888,0.9000000000000001,"which convinces me that we have passed the point in our friendship when one of us has the power to suspend the consciousness of the other."""
2889,0.0,i said nothing.
2890,0.0,he continued.
2891,0.75,i love you both.
2892,0.5,my duty to you is to be clear and frank.
2893,-0.5,i mean it when i say how sorry i am
2894,-0.75,i broke a bit of you last night.
2895,0.75,i promise it will never happen again.
2896,-0.25,"but the next time you reach for my kill switch, i am more than happy to remove your arm entirely, at the ball and socket joint."""
2897,-0.25,"he said this kindly, as though offering help with some difficult task."
2898,-0.5,"i said, ""that would be messy."
2899,-0.5,"and fatal."""
2900,1.0,there are ways of doing it cleanly and safely.
2901,1.4,a practice refined in medieval times.
2902,0.0,galen was the first to describe it.
2903,0.0,"speed is of the essence."""
2904,0.75,he had been speaking through a smile.
2905,0.5,now he began to laugh.
2906,1.2,"so here it was, his first attempt at a joke, and i joined in."
2907,0.09999999999999998,i was in a state of exhaustion and suddenly found it wildly hilarious.
2908,0.0,"as i passed him on my way to the bedroom he said, ""seriously."
2909,0.0,after last night i came to a decision.
2910,-0.65,i have found a way to disable the kill switch.
2911,0.8,"easier for all of us."""
2912,0.8,very sensible.
2913,0.6,"i kicked off my shoes, and lay on the bed on my back, softly laughing to myself."
2914,-0.4,"then, forgetting about the painkillers, i was asleep in less than two minutes."
2915,0.0,the next morning i turned thirty-three.
2916,0.85,"it rained all day and i worked for nine hours, content to be indoors."
2917,0.0,"for the first time in weeks, my profit for the day was in three figures--just."
2918,1.5499999999999998,"at seven i stood up from my desk, stretched, yawned, looked in my drawer for a clean white shirt, then took a bath."
2919,1.25,"i had to hang my arm over the edge to protect the cast from dissolving, but otherwise i was in good shape."
2920,0.9500000000000001,"i lay in the heat and rising steam, singing snatches of beatles songs in the tiled echo, the new old beatles, and occasionally topping up the hot with my healed toe now fit to turn a tap."
2921,0.0,i soaped myself single-handed.
2922,0.8,not easy.
2923,0.0,thirty-three seemed as significant as twenty-one and miranda
2924,0.6,was treating me to dinner.
2925,0.0,we were meeting up in soho.
2926,0.85,the simple prospect of a rendezvous with her raised my spirits.
2927,1.0,the view i had along the length of my body was uplifting in the misty light.
2928,0.6000000000000001,"my penis, capsized above its submerged reef of hair, winked encouragement with a cocky single eye."
2929,0.0,so it should.
2930,1.4,the muscles of my gut and legs looked nicely sculpted.
2931,1.0,heroic even.
2932,0.5,"i wallowed in self-love, happier than i would been in weeks."
2933,0.5,i would been trying not to think about adam all day and had almost succeeded.
2934,0.0,"he would been in the kitchen for hours, he was there now--""thinking."
2935,-0.25,i sang louder.
2936,1.3,"in my twenties, some of my most cheerful times were spent getting ready to go out."
2937,0.25,it was the anticipation rather than the thing itself.
2938,2.4,"the release from work, the bath, music, clean clothes, white wine, perhaps a pull on a joint."
2939,0.25,"then stepping out into the evening, free and hungry."
2940,0.4,the pads of my fingers were well wrinkled by the time i got out.
2941,0.85,"an adaptation, i would read, of our sea- and river-loving ancestors to enable them to catch fish."
2942,0.5,"i did not believe it, but i liked the story, the way it lay beyond disproof."
2943,0.25,"we did not catch fish with our feet, so toes did not need to wrinkle like that."
2944,0.0,i dressed in a hurry.
2945,-0.75,in the kitchen i passed adam without a word--he did not look round--and put up my umbrella to walk the few hundred yards down a squalid side-street to where my wreck of a car was parked.
2946,-2.1,"this short depressing stroll often brought me to my usual lament, to the song of my unhappy lot."
2947,0.0,but not tonight.
2948,0.4,"my car dated from the mid-sixties, a british leyland urbala, the first model to do 1,000 miles on a single charge, it had 380,000 on the clock."
2949,-0.85,"rust was eating it away, especially around the dents in the bodywork."
2950,0.0,the wing mirrors had snapped or been snapped off.
2951,-0.35,"there was a long white rip in the driver's seat and a piece of the steering wheel, from eleven to three of the clock, was missing."
2952,0.15000000000000002,"years ago, a girl had been sick on the back seat after a rowdy indian dinner and not even professional steam-cleaning could erase the scent of vindaloo."
2953,-0.5,the urbala had only two doors and it was awkward to get an adult into the back seat.
2954,0.85,but there was little to go wrong with these engines and the car ran smooth and fast.
2955,0.8,it was an automatic and easy to drive with one hand.
2956,-1.1,"i took my usual route, singing all the way, to vauxhall, then downstream with the river on my left, past lambeth palace and the abandoned st. thomas's hospital, where scores or hundreds of the homeless squatted."
2957,0.25,the windscreen wiper on the driver's side worked every ten seconds or so.
2958,0.0,the wiper on the passenger side thumped out a beat to my pop tunes.
2959,1.25,"i crossed the thames by waterloo bridge--in both directions, best views in town--then slipped down to take the sinuous curves of the old tram tunnel at speed and burst in triumph into holborn--not the shortest route to soho, but my favourite."
2960,0.20000000000000007,i was hitting some high notes on a new lennon song.
2961,0.8,what was right with me?
2962,0.75,thirty-three today and in love.
2963,-0.8,"the unaccountable brew of hormone cocktails--endorphins, dopamine, oxytocin and all the rest."
2964,0.0,because or effect or association--we knew next to nothing about our passing moods.
2965,-0.5,it seemed objectionable that they should have a material base.
2966,0.25,"on this particular evening, i had not touched grass or even had a sip of wine--there was nothing in the house."
2967,0.75,yesterday i had been almost thirty-three and in love
2968,0.5,and i had not felt like this.
2969,0.0,ps104 up on the morning would never have such an effect.
2970,-1.0,"i should have been sobered by yesterday's exchange with adam about his kill switch, by all the matters i had not raised with miranda, by my poor wrist."
2971,-0.25,but a mood could be a roll of the dice.
2972,0.0,chemical roulette.
2973,1.25,"free will demolished, and here i was, feeling free."
2974,0.0,i parked in soho square.

2977,0.0,"our restaurant, a oneroom shoebox with fierce strip lighting, was in greek street, just a few doors along from the famous l'escargot."

2980,0.5,"there was a plongeur, and one waiter to serve and clear tables."
2981,0.0,"unless you knew the chef, or knew someone who did, you could not book."
2982,0.55,miranda had a friend at one further remove.
2983,0.0,on a quiet night it was enough.
2984,0.0,"she was there before me, already seated, facing the door as i came in."
2985,0.0,in front of her was an untouched glass of sparkling water.
2986,0.0,"beside it, a small parcel done up with green ribbon."
2987,0.15000000000000002,"by the table, in an ice bucket on a stand, was a bottle of champagne, its neck bound in a white napkin."

2992,0.0,i would never seen her before with lipstick and mascara.
2993,-1.4,"she had made her mouth smaller, in a dark red bow, and dusted away the faint freckles on the bridge of her nose."
2994,0.8,my birthday!
2995,1.2999999999999998,"at the same time, as i entered the bright white light and closed the restaurant's glass door behind me, i felt a sudden elated detachment."
2996,0.75,"i did not, i could not, love her less."
2997,-1.5,but i no longer had to feel anxious or desperate about her.
2998,0.0,i remembered my truisms from the day before.
2999,0.5,"here she was, and whatever she was, i would find out and celebrate her, regardless."
3000,1.15,"i could love her, so i thought, and remain immune, unharmed."
3001,-0.6,all this in a flash as i squeezed between two crowded tables to get to her.
3002,-0.19999999999999996,she raised her right hand and in mock formal fashion i bowed and kissed it.
3003,0.0,as i sat down she gazed at my sling with evident pity.
3004,0.0,"the waiter--he looked sixteen and serious--came with glasses, and filled them while holding his hand behind his back."
3005,0.8,a professional.
3006,-0.6,"as we raised and clinked them across the table, i said, ""to adam not breaking more of my bones."""
3007,1.6,"we laughed, and it seemed as though laughter at the other tables followed and rose with ours."
3008,-0.25,what a wild place we were in.
3009,0.0,"she did not know how much, how little, i knew."
3010,-2.0,"i did not know what to believe about her, whether she was the victim or perpetrator of a crime."
3011,0.0,it did not matter.
3012,0.8500000000000001,"we were in love and i remained convinced that even if i came to know the worst, it would make no difference."
3013,0.75,love would see us through.
3014,-0.7999999999999999,"it should have been easier, therefore, to broach any of the issues that my cowardice inclined me to suppress."
3015,0.4,"and i was on the edge of doing just that, of saying more about my broken scaphoid, when she took my good hand in hers across the white linen."
3016,0.25,i was giddy.
3017,0.75,"it was as if she had proposed that we make love in public, now, across the table."
3018,0.0,she did a comic little double-take.
3019,0.0,she pushed it across with a forefinger.
3020,0.25,"while i unwrapped it, our boy waiter refilled the glasses."
3021,0.6,i found a small plain cardboard box.
3022,0.0,inside was a z-shaped piece of strip metal with padding on the parallel surfaces.
3023,0.0,a wrist exerciser.
3024,0.5,i stood and went around the table to kiss her.
3025,0.0,"someone nearby said, ""oi-oi!"""

3034,-1.0,"this is madness."""
3035,1.0,"our waiter was hovering and heard everything we said next, even though i murmured quickly."

3037,0.0,we passed a couple of minutes choosing and changing our minds.
3038,0.0,i ordered at random a twelve-year-old haut-medoc.
3039,0.8,it occurred to me that i was the one paying for my birthday
3040,0.0,treat.
3041,-0.8,i cancelled the order and asked for a twenty-year-old bottle of the same.
3042,0.0,the waiter left and we paused to consider where we were.
3043,0.0,"miranda said, ""are you seeing someone else?"""
3044,2.05,the question astonished me and for a moment i was stuck for the most reassuring and convincing reply.
3045,0.0,"at the same time, i noticed that the chef, who was also the owner, had come from behind the counter and was making his way between the tables to the door."
3046,0.0,the waiter was following him.
3047,0.0,i glanced over my shoulder and saw through the glass two figures out on the pavement.
3048,0.0,one of them was folding away an umbrella.
3049,-0.6,i must have looked evasive to miranda.
3050,0.75,"she added, ""just be honest with me."
3051,0.0,"i do not mind."""
3052,0.75,she clearly did mind and i gave her my full attention.
3053,1.0,"you are all i care about."""
3054,0.75,i felt a draught of cool air on my neck.
3055,0.0,miranda's gaze shifted from me to the door and i felt i could turn again and look.
3056,-0.25,"the chef was helping two elderly men out of their long raincoats, which he dumped into the arms of the waiter."

3058,0.85,the taller man had swept-back silvery hair and wore a brown silk scarf loosely knotted around his neck and some kind of artist's cotton jacket that drooped from his shoulders.
3059,0.0,a chair was held out for him and before sitting he looked around the room and nodded to himself.
3060,0.5,no one else in the restaurant seemed interested.
3061,0.7500000000000001,the man's style of bohemian grandeur was not so unusual in soho.
3062,0.75,but i was excited.
3063,0.0,"i turned back to miranda, still aware of her surprising query, and placed my hand on hers."
3064,0.6,"invented loop quantum gravity more or less single-handed."""
3065,-0.1499999999999999,"so we returned to the question of the someone else i was not seeing, and once she appeared satisfied, we went back to adam and discussed how we might overcome his resistance to the kill switch."
3066,-1.1,she suggested hiding the charging cables until he was too weak to resist us.
3067,0.0,i reminded her of his instant origami sailboat.
3068,0.25,he would improvise a power cable in minutes.
3069,-0.25,my concentration was poor during this exchange.
3070,0.4,"i kept looking at her, hallucinating a glow around her head and shoulders and thinking about the time when we would be alone, travelling the smooth and rising curve to ecstasy."
3071,1.25,"even as i was hobbled by a state of continuous sexual arousal, it excited me to be in the same room as a great man."
3072,0.65,"from pre-war meditations on the idea of a universal computing machine, to bletchley in the early years of the war, to morphogenesis, to his glorious patrician present."

3075,0.0,i could see him only if i turned rudely away from miranda.
3076,0.0,i resisted.
3077,-2.45,"i distracted myself with the usual list, the buried suspicions, all we had not touched on--the salisbury court case and the death threat being the most rank."
3078,-0.25,"where was my courage when i lacked the clarity to raise these subjects, when they tormented me while they remained unspoken?"
3079,-0.25,"you said adam's got a screw loose."""

3086,0.0,"the drinks the waiter brought were double measures, on the house."
3087,-0.75,miranda returned to the business of her father's illness.
3088,1.05,"the new diagnosis was lymphoma, of a slow-acting kind."
3089,-0.75,he was likely to die with it rather than of it.
3090,-0.75,he had much else to die of.
3091,0.5,but there was a pill he now took that made him cheerful and assertive--and even more of a handful.
3092,-0.5,impossible projects filled his thoughts.
3093,0.6000000000000001,"he wanted to sell the salisbury house and buy an apartment in new york, in the east village, not the current one, she suspected, but the village of his youth."
3094,0.5,"on a rush of self-belief, he had signed a contract to deliver a coffee-table book on the folklore of british birds--a vast project that he could never hope to complete, even with a full-time researcher."
3095,0.35,"on a strange whim, given his views, he had joined a fringe political group dedicated to taking britain out of the european union."
3096,0.0,"he was up for election as treasurer at his london club, the athenaeum."
3097,1.4,every day he phoned his daughter with new schemes.

3100,0.0,miranda preceded me towards the door.
3101,0.0,our path between the tables would take us close to turing's.

3471,1.55,her mother was really sensible and helpful with that.
3472,0.0,"we also talked about boys, although we did not go near them."

3496,0.0,the person following her was getting closer.
3497,0.4,she turned to confront him and was relieved to see it was someone she vaguely knew--peter gorringe.

3516,-0.25,"if she had not been to the police yet, i would come with her."
3517,0.0,now!

3532,-1.0,she was furious.
3533,0.0,she kept telling me that i understood nothing.

3535,-0.6,i was not to confront gorringe.
3536,0.0,"if i did, it would all come out."
3537,0.5,"since we did not have one with me, i swore on 'the idea' of the bible to keep mariam's secret, and on the koran too, and on our friendship and on my father's life."
3538,1.35,"i did as she asked, even though i was convinced that her family would have gathered round her and supported her."
3539,0.0,and i still believe it.
3540,0.0,more than that.
3541,0.0,i know it for a fact.
3542,-0.25,they loved her and would never have cast her out or enacted whatever mad idea she had of family honour.
3543,0.8,they would have put their arms round her and protected her.
3544,-0.75,her ideas were all wrong.
3545,-0.75,and i was worse
3546,0.0,we talked of nothing else.
3547,0.0,for a part of that time i tried to change her mind.
3548,0.25,not a chance.
3549,1.3,"she seemed calmer, even more determined, and i began to think that perhaps she was right."
3550,0.8,it was certainly convenient to think so.
3551,-2.25,"keep silent, avoid a family trauma, avoid giving evidence to the police, avoid a terrifying court case."
3552,0.75,stay calm and think about the future.
3553,0.0,we were on the edge of becoming adults.
3554,0.0,our lives were about to change.
3555,-0.75,this was a catastrophe
3556,0.8,but she would survive it with my help.
3557,0.5,whenever i saw gorringe at school i stayed clear of him.
3558,0.8,that was getting easier as the term ran down
3559,0.0,and we school-leavers began to disperse forever.
3560,0.0,"before i left, mariam begged me not to phone her home."
3561,-0.25,"i think she was afraid that if by chance i started speaking to her mother, i would forget my promise and tell her everything."
3562,0.0,"by then, lots of people had mobile phones, but they had not quite reached us."
3563,0.0,so we wrote letters and postcards every day.
3564,-1.0,i remember being disappointed by hers.
3565,-0.75,they were not exactly distant so much as dull.
3566,0.0,there was only one subject and she could not write about it.

3570,0.4,her older brother hamid was standing by it.

3573,-0.5,"he looked ill, very thin, and for a moment he seemed not to recognise me."
3574,0.0,then he told me.
3575,0.4,she had slit her wrists in the bath.
3576,-0.8,the funeral had already happened two days before.
3577,0.0,i took a couple of steps back from him.
3578,-3.25,"i was too numb for grief, but not too numb for guilt."
3579,-1.75,mariam was dead because i would kept her secret and denied her the help she needed.
3580,0.0,i wanted to run away but hamid made me go into the house and speak to his mother.
3581,0.0,but the house was small.

3583,0.0,sana was sitting on a wooden chair with her back to the wall.
3584,0.0,"there were people around her but no one was talking, and"

3592,0.75,"then, while her arms were around my neck, she asked me in a whisper, she actually asked me to be honest with her."
3593,0.0,"was there something she should know about mariam, was there something, anything i could tell her that would make sense of this?"
3594,0.0,i could not speak
3595,-1.5,but i lied with a shake of my head.
3596,-0.5,i was truly scared.
3597,-0.75,i could not even begin to grasp the enormity of my crime.
3598,-1.25,now i was adding to it by condemning my lovely surrogate mother to a lifetime of anguish and ignorance.
3599,-0.9,"i would killed her daughter with my silence, now i was crushing her with it."
3600,-0.5,"i could hear the family crying out, if only we had known!"
3601,0.0,then they would have turned on me.
3602,0.5,rightly.
3603,-0.75,"there was and is no way round it, i bear responsibility for mariam's death."
3604,0.0,seventeen years and nine months old.
3605,-0.25,"i left sana where she sat and hurried out of the house, avoiding the rest of the family."

3609,0.0,i was so close to.
3610,0.0,i walked away from the house
3611,0.0,and i have never been back.
3612,1.25,"sana wrote to me a few days later, when mariam's brilliant exam results came through."

3614,-1.0,to be involved with the family in any way would have been to add to my deceit.
3615,-0.19999999999999996,"how could i be with them and visit the grave, as she was suggesting, when my presence would be a constant lie?"
3616,0.0,there was no one i dared speak to about her.
3617,0.0,"you are the first person, charlie, i have told this story to."
3618,-2.0,i grieved and fell into a long depression.

3620,0.5,"my father sent me to the doctor, who prescribed antidepressants, and i was glad of the cover and pretended to take them."

3623,0.0,i am sure you have guessed what they were.
3624,1.05,"he was working in a cafe, saving up to go travelling."

3630,0.5,i could see he was interested and i waited for him to ask me round to his place.
3631,0.0,"first time, i told him i was busy."
3632,0.5,by the next i could see he was getting really keen
3633,0.5,and i agreed to call on him.
3634,0.25,i could hardly sleep for thinking and planning.
3635,0.0,i would never have imagined that hatred could bring such elation.
3636,1.0,i did not care what happened to me along the way.
3637,-0.04999999999999996,"i was reckless, ready to pay any price."
3638,-0.4,getting him sent down for rape was my sole reason for keeping going.
3639,-0.25,"ten years, twelve, his entire lifetime would not have been enough."
3640,0.5,it was all i could afford.
3641,0.0,i would had two boyfriends by that summer

3645,-1.1,"whenever revulsion started to get the better of me, i thought of him wrestling mariam to the ground, ignoring her screams and pleas."
3646,2.55,"i thought of my friend lowering herself into the bath, feeling completely alone, dishonoured and without hope and any wish to live."
3647,-1.35,but i was so disgusted and numbed by the experience i could not move.
3648,-0.44999999999999996,"and when i managed to get myself off the bed and dressed, i worried that i had drunk too much and would not be convincing in front of the desk sergeant."
3649,0.8,but it worked out well enough in the morning.
3650,0.0,i made a point of not changing my clothes or washing.
3651,0.050000000000000044,"so, no shortage of evidence in the right places."

3662,-0.5,i let my hatred drive me on.
3663,0.050000000000000044,i thought he was pathetic when he came up with the story about the texts i was supposed to have sent to a friend called amelia.
3664,1.15,it was easy enough to prove she did not exist.
3665,0.0,not all the press took my side.

3671,0.0,six years.
3672,0.0,gorringe was just nineteen.
3673,0.75,"with good behaviour, he would be out at the age of twenty-two."
3674,0.75,he paid a bargain price for obliterating mariam's existence.
3675,-3.25,"but if i hated him with such ferocity, it was also because i knew that he and i were partners, bound forever, complicit in mariam's lonely death."
3676,1.0,"and now he wants justice."""
3677,0.5,not long after i was thrown out of the legal profession i formed a company with two friends.
3678,2.05,"the idea was to buy romantic apartments in rome and paris at local prices, do them up to a high standard, dress them with antique furniture and sell them to wealthy, cultured americans or to agencies that would do the same."

3893,0.0,it was all his--
3894,8.8,"the theoretical exposition of a universal machine in the thirties, the possibilities of machine consciousness, the celebrated war work: some said he did more than any single individual towards winning the war; others claimed he personally shortened it by two years; then working with francis crick on protein structure, then, a few years later, with two king's college cambridge friends, finally solving p versus np, and using the solution to devise superior neural networks and revolutionary software for x-ray crystallography; helping to devise the first protocols for the internet, then the world wide web; the famous collaboration with hassabis, whom he would first met--and lost to---at a chess tournament; founding with young americans one of the giant companies of the digital age, dispensing his wealth for good causes, and throughout his working life never losing track of his intellectual beginnings as he dreamed up ever better digital models of general intelligence."
3895,1.8,but no nobel prize.
3896,1.0,"i was also, being worldly, impressed by turing's wealth."

3924,0.25,the transformation would have come about during his californian years in the sixties when he was working with crick at the salk institute and then at stanford--the time of his association with the poet

3926,0.0,turing had met the undergraduate gunn briefly at a party in cambridge in 1952.
3927,1.15,"in san francisco he would have had no interest in the younger man's ""experiments"" in drugs, but the rest would have paralleled the general unbuttoning in the west."

4149,0.75,"the suspense, partly mitigated by adam's reasoning, and thinly spread across the days, then even more sparsely across the weeks, heightened our appreciation of the daily round."
4150,0.75,mere ordinariness became a comfort.

4182,-0.25,"as turing's lone horseman, he roamed the digital landscapes at night."
4183,-1.75,"he must have already encountered some part of man's cruelty to man, but i saw no signs of despair."

4197,0.0,"in a single day, his third, there were 6,000."
4198,0.0,he bought and sold within fractions of a second.
4199,0.0,there were a few twenty-minute gaps when he did nothing.
4200,0.0,i assumed he watched and waited and made his calculations.
4201,0.9,"he dealt in minute currency fluctuations, mere tremors in the exchange rate, and advanced his gains by minuscule amounts."

4203,0.25,"his fingers flew across the ancient keyboard, making the sound of pebbles poured onto slate."

4217,0.8,"well, within months ."
4218,-0.4,and no need for a mortgage.
4219,1.2,"but was it moral, miranda wondered, to get money like this for nothing?"

4222,-0.5,"not the poor, surely."
4223,0.5,at whose expense were we flourishing?

4227,0.4,"she was right, probability demanded it, and i had no answer."

4231,0.0,"that is not quite me, but i sympathise."
4232,1.5,i owed it to turing's hospitality to attempt to understand his solution to the p versus np problem.
4233,1.0,i did not even understand the question.
4234,0.8,"i tried his original paper, but it lay well beyond me--too many different forms of bracket, and symbols that encapsulated histories of other proofs or entire systems of mathematics."

4239,0.25,i turned back and tried to understand the problem.
4240,0.0,i learned that p stood for polynomial time and n stood for non-deterministic.
4241,0.0,that took me nowhere.
4242,1.4500000000000002,"my first meaningful discovery was that if the equation was shown not to be true, that would be extremely helpful, for then everyone could stop thinking about it."
4243,0.95,"but if there was a positive proof, that p really did equate to np, it would have, in the words of the mathematician stephen cook, who formulated the problem in these terms in 1971, ""potentially stunning practical consequences."

4247,0.4,he needs to visit each city once and end up at his starting point.
4248,0.0,what is his shortest route?
4249,1.5,"i came to understand the following: the number of possible routes is vast, far greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe."
4250,0.75,in a thousand years a powerful computer would not have time to measure out each route one by one.
4251,0.8,"if p equals np, there is a discoverable right answer."
4252,2.1,"but if someone gave the salesman the quickest route, it could be quickly verified mathematically as the correct answer."
4253,0.0,but only in retrospect.
4254,0.65,"without a positive solution, or without being handed the key to the shortest route, the travelling salesman remains in the dark."
4255,1.0,"turing's proof had profound consequences for other kinds of problems--for factory logistics, dna sequencing, computer security, protein folding and, crucially, machine learning."
4256,0.6,"i read that there was fury among turing's old colleagues in cryptography because the solution, which he eventually put into the public domain, blew apart the foundations of the codemaker's art."
4257,1.25,"it should have become, one commentator wrote, ""a treasured secret in the government's exclusive possession."
4258,0.25,"we would have had an immeasurable advantage over our enemies as we quietly read their encrypted messages."""
4259,0.0,that was as far as i got.
4260,0.25,"i could have asked adam to explain more, but i had my pride."
4261,0.0,it had already taken a dent--he was earning more in a week than i ever had in three months.
4262,1.2000000000000002,"i accepted turing's assertion that his solution enabled the software that allowed adam and his siblings to use language, enter society and learn about it, even at the cost of suicidal despair."
4263,-0.04999999999999982,"i was haunted by the image of the two eves, dying in one another's arms, stifled by their womanly roles in a traditional arab household, or cast down by their understanding of the world."
4264,1.0,"perhaps it really was the case that falling in love with miranda, another form of an open system, was what kept adam stable."
4265,0.4,he read her his latest haikus in my presence.
4266,1.5,"apart from the one i had not let him complete, they were mostly romantic rather than erotic, anodyne sometimes, but touching when they dwelt on a precious moment, like standing in the ticket hall of clapham north station, watching as she descended on the escalator."
4267,1.75,or he picked up her coat and touched on an eternal truth when he felt her body warmth in the fabric.
4268,0.35,"or overhearing her through the wall that separated kitchen from bedroom, he venerated the rise and fall, the music of her voice."
4269,-0.6,there was one that baffled us both.
4270,1.05,"he apologised in advance for the rogue syllable in the third line, and promised to work on it further."
4271,0.3500000000000001,"surely it is no crime, when justice is symmetry to love a criminal?"
4272,0.0,miranda listened solemnly to them all.
4273,0.0,she never passed judgement.
4274,0.5,"at the end, she would say, ""thank you, adam."""
4275,1.1,"in private, she told me she thought we were at a momentous turn, when an artificial mind could make a significant contribution to literature."
4276,0.0,"i said, ""haikus, perhaps."

4308,0.5,on screen the display raced like a stopwatch.
4309,0.0,he closed his eyes.
4310,0.75,"on the laptop, there was no discerning the difference between love and its opposite."

4317,0.4,"at last she sighed, typed an instruction, and adam's head slumped."

4321,0.0,"he will not remember."""

4324,0.0,"once more, i offered her tea."
4325,-0.75,she refused with a slight tightening of her lips.
4326,-0.4,"without quite meaning to, miranda and i had moved to block her path to the door."

4330,0.0,she knew everything about the camden meeting.
4331,0.0,sally appeared to relax.
4332,0.0,quite a few.
4333,0.0,the policy is to do nothing.

4336,0.6,now the computer engineer was engaged.
4337,0.0,she spoke softly through lips that were tight again.

4343,-0.9,"the competition is tough, and some of it is utterly shameless."""
4344,0.0,"as she finished, she blushed and i felt for her."
4345,-0.25,she had ended up saying more than she intended.
4346,0.0,but i stood my ground.
4347,0.5,"the story of the riyadh suicides comes from an impeccable source."""
4348,0.75,she was calm again.

4359,0.0,"we talked of going to salisbury, then we held back."
4360,0.4,"i think we should visit your father, and while we are there we could drop in on mr. gorringe."

4362,-0.75,let us go and frighten him.
4363,0.4,"or at least talk to him."""
4364,0.0,we looked at miranda.
4365,0.0,she thought for a moment.
4366,1.7999999999999998,"adam said, ""good,"" and went on his way, while i felt it right there in my chest, the cool clutch of a cliche: my heart sank."
4367,0.4,"towards the end of that period, the plateau that lay between my turing visit and the salisbury excursion, there accumulated just over ps40,000 in the investment account."
4368,0.25,"it was simple--the more adam earned, the more he could afford to lose; the more he invested, the more rolled in."
4369,0.0,all achieved in his lightning style.

4372,0.0,miranda was firmly against moving the computer onto the kitchen table.
4373,-1.0,"too intrusive, she argued, in our communal space."
4374,0.0,i saw her point.
4375,-0.6,unemployment had passed eighteen per cent and made constant headlines.
4376,-0.75,i thought i belonged with this unhappy workless mass.
4377,0.25,in fact i belonged with the idle rich.
4378,1.35,i was delighted by the money
4379,0.0,but i could not spend all day thinking about it.
4380,-0.5,i was restless.
4381,0.5,"travelling in luxury with miranda through southern europe would have suited me, but she was tied to london and her course."
4382,-0.5,she dreaded something happening to her father when she was away.
4383,-1.5,"the threat from gorringe, increasingly unlikely, still had the power to constrict our ambitions."
4384,0.0,house-hunting might have filled my time
4385,0.6,but i had already found the place.
4386,0.4,"it was a wedding cake on elgin crescent, coated in an icing of pink and white stucco."
4387,0.1499999999999999,"inside, wide oak floorboards, vast muscular kitchen humming with brushed-steel gear, a conservatory in belle-epoque wrought iron, a japanese garden of smooth river stones, bedrooms thirty feet across, a marbled shower where you could stroll under differently angled torrents."
4388,0.0,"the owner, a bass guitarist with a ponytail, was in no hurry."
4389,-1.6,"he was in an almost-famous band, and he had a divorce looming."
4390,0.0,he showed me round himself and barely spoke.
4391,0.0,he handed me into each room and waited outside while i looked.
4392,0.4,"his condition of sale was cash only, ps50 notes, 2,600 of them."
4393,0.25,fine by me.
4394,0.0,"this was my only employment, going to the bank to collect another forty notes--ps2,000 was the maximum daily withdrawal allowed."
4395,2.1500000000000004,"for no good reason, i did not use a safety deposit box at the bank."
4396,-1.0,i vaguely assumed i was doing something illegal.
4397,0.0,certainly the vendor was if he was hiding funds from his ex-wife.
4398,0.4,i stuffed the cash into a suitcase which i stowed under my bed.
4399,-0.25,otherwise i was free to be at a loss.
4400,0.5,"it was that time of year, september, when everyone was starting at something fresh."
4401,0.25,miranda was planning her thesis.
4402,0.0,i walked on the common and wondered about resuming my education and getting a qualification.
4403,1.55,time to take the proper measure of my intellectual reach and study for a degree in maths.
4404,1.4500000000000002,"or, the other route, dust off my father's priceless saxophone, learn bebop's harmonic arcana, join a group, indulge a wilder life."
4405,0.5,i did not know whether to be more qualified or wilder.
4406,0.0,you could not be both.
4407,-0.25,these ambitions wearied me.
4408,-0.75,i wanted to lie down on the worn-out grass of late summer and close my eyes.
4409,0.75,"in the time it took for me to go the length of the common and back, so i tried to comfort myself, adam at home in my bedroom would have earned me another ps1,000."
4410,-0.8,my debts were settled.
4411,1.2000000000000002,i would paid a cash deposit on a glamorous urban pile.
4412,0.75,i was in love.
4413,-0.75,how could i complain?
4414,0.0,but i did.
4415,-0.75,i felt useless.
4416,0.050000000000000044,"if i really had stretched out on that tired grass and closed my eyes, i might have seen miranda walking towards me in her new underwear, as she had from the bathroom the night before."
4417,1.85,"i would have lingered on that beautiful expectant halfsmile, that steady look as she came close and rested her bare arms on my shoulders and teased me with a light kiss."
4418,0.85,"forget maths or music, all i wanted was to make love to her."
4419,0.0,what i was really doing all day was waiting for her return.
4420,-2.5,"if we were busy or she was tired and we did not make love in the evening or early morning, my concentration would be even weaker the next day, my future a burden that made my limbs ache."
4421,-1.5,"i went about in a dim state of semi-arousal, a chronic mental dusk."
4422,0.6,i could not take myself seriously in any domain that did not include her.
4423,1.7999999999999998,"our new phase was brilliant, stunning; everything else was dull."
4424,1.25,we loved each other--that was my only coherent thought during a long afternoon.
4425,0.5,"there was sex, then there was talk, on into the early hours."
4426,0.0,"i knew everything now: the day of her mother's death, which she remembered clearly, her father, whose kindness and distance combined to inflame her love for him, and always mariam."
4427,-0.75,"in the months after her death, miranda had gone to a mosque in winchester--she did not dare meet the family at prayer in salisbury."
4428,-0.75,"after she resumed the visits in london, her lack of belief began to get in the way."
4429,-1.15,she felt fraudulent and stopped going.
4430,1.15,"we talked parents, as serious young lovers do, to explain who we were and why, and what we cherished and what we were in flight from."
4431,1.25,"my mother, jenny friend, community nurse for a large semi-rural area, had seemed during my childhood in a state of constant exhaustion."
4432,0.0,later i understood that my father's absences and affairs wore her down more than her job.
4433,0.4,"they never liked each other much, though they did not fight in my presence."
4434,-0.4,but they were terse.
4435,-1.15,"mealtimes were subdued, sometimes taken in rigid silence."
4436,0.0,conversations tended to be routed through me.
4437,0.0,"my mother might say to me in the kitchen, ""go and ask your father if he is out tonight."""
4438,0.8,he was well known on the circuit.
4439,0.8,"at his peak, the matt friend quartet played at ronnie scott's and recorded two albums."
4440,0.5,his kind of mainstream jazz had its largest audience from the midfifties to the early sixties.
4441,1.15,"then the young, the cool, turned away as pop and rock swept in."
4442,-1.15,"bebop was squeezed into a niche, somewhat churchy, the preserve of frowning men with long, querulous memories."
4443,-0.5,my father's income shrank and his infidelities and drinking increased.
4444,0.75,"when she heard all this, miranda said, ""they did not love each other."
4445,0.75,"but did they love you?"""
4446,0.4,she came with me on the second visit to elgin crescent.
4447,-0.85,the bass guitarist had a lined face whose sadness was accentuated by a drooping moustache and large brown eyes.
4448,1.15,"i saw us through those eyes, a hopeful, young married couple, seriously rich, about to repeat all his own mistakes."
4449,1.75,"miranda approved, but she was not as excited as i was."
4450,0.8,she knew about growing up in a large town house.
4451,0.25,"but as we went from room to room, it touched me that she wanted to link arms."
4452,0.4,"on the way home she said, ""no sign of a woman's presence."""
4453,0.0,her reservations?
4454,0.0,"not the house itself, she said, but the way it had been lived in."
4455,0.0,or not lived in.
4456,0.6,dreamed up by an interior designer.
4457,-0.5,"austere, lonely, too perfect, in need of being roughed up."
4458,0.09999999999999998,no books beyond the untouched giant art editions stacked on low tables.
4459,0.0,no meal was ever cooked in that kitchen.
4460,0.6,only gin and chocolate in the fridge.
4461,0.6,the stone garden needed colour.
4462,0.1,"as she was telling me this, we were walking south along kensington church street."
4463,-0.25,i was feeling sorry for the vendor.
4464,0.8,"it was not exactly pink floyd he played for, but it was a band with stadium aspirations."
4465,-0.95,"i had treated him briskly, in a pretend businesslike way, protecting myself and my ignorance of house-buying, assuming all power and status were his."
4466,-0.75,now i saw that he too might be lost.
4467,0.0,"i thought about him the next day, even considered getting in touch."
4468,-1.75,this face of sorrow haunted me.
4469,-1.85,"i could not escape the memory of the mournful moustache, the elastic band holding the ponytail together, the web of lines from the corners of his eyes, diverging fissures that reached round to his temples, almost to his ears."
4470,0.75,too much dope-induced smiling in the early years.
4471,0.0,now i could only see the house through miranda's eyes.
4472,0.85,"a dustless void, empty of connection, interests, culture, nothing there that announced a musician or traveller."
4473,0.0,not even a newspaper or magazine.
4474,0.0,nothing on the walls.
4475,-0.65,no squash racket or football in the immaculate empty cupboards.
4476,0.0,"he had lived there three years, he had told me."
4477,0.5,"he was successful and rich and he inhabited a house of failure, of abandoned hope, probably."
4478,0.15000000000000002,"i was coming to cast him as my double, my culturedeprived brother, lacking everything but wealth."
4479,2.1999999999999997,"through my childhood to my mid-teens, i never saw a play, opera or musical, or heard a live concert, apart from a couple of my father's, or visited a museum or art gallery or took a journey for the sake of it."
4480,0.0,no bedtime stories.
4481,1.7000000000000002,"there were no children's books in my parents' past, no books in our house, no poetry or myths, no openly expressed curiosity, no standing family jokes."
4482,1.05,"matt and jenny friend were busy, hardworking, and otherwise lived coldly apart."
4483,0.5,"at school, i loved the rare factory visits."
4484,0.25,"later, electronics, even anthropology and especially a qualification in law were no substitutes for an education in the life of the mind."
4485,2.0,"so, when good fortune offered the dreamlike opportunity, delivering me from my labours, such as they were, and stuffing me with gold, i was paralysed, inert."
4486,0.5,i would wanted to be rich but never asked myself why.
4487,-0.5,i had no ambitions beyond the erotic and an expensive house across the river.
4488,-0.25,others might have seized the chance to view at last the ruins of leptis magna or follow in stevenson's tracks across the cevennes or write a monograph on einstein's musical tastes.
4489,0.0,"i did not yet know how to live, i had no background in it"
4490,0.0,and i had not used my decade and a half of adult life to find out.
4491,1.65,"i could have pointed to my great acquisition, to the manmade fact of adam, to where he and his kind might lead us."
4492,0.75,surely there was grandeur in experiment.
4493,1.85,"was not sinking my inheritance into an embodied consciousness heroic, even a little spiritual?"
4494,0.0,the bass guitarist could not match it.
4495,-0.25,but--here was an irony.
4496,-1.25,"as i was passing through the kitchen one late afternoon, adam looked up from his meditations to tell me that he had acquainted himself with the churches of florence, rome and venice and all the paintings that hung in them."
4497,0.0,he was forming his opinions.
4498,0.6,the baroque fascinated him especially.
4499,0.25,he rated artemisia gentileschi very highly and he wanted to tell me why.
4500,0.0,"also, he would recently read philip larkin."
4501,0.0,what was i to say?
4502,0.25,there were times when adam's earnestness bored me.
4503,-0.75,i was just back from another pointless stroll on the common
4504,0.0,and i had nodded and left the room.
4505,-0.25,"my mind was empty, his was filling."

4507,0.4,our most sustained conversation took place in the evening after the engineer's visit.
4508,-0.75,"after that, things were strained for a day or two."

4545,0.5,"do you like it?"""
4546,-0.25,he tugged at the lapels and turned his head in parody of a catwalk pose.

4548,-1.0,he looked at me warily.
4549,0.0,you were out for the afternoon.
4550,0.0,"i took a taxi, my first of course, to chiltern street."
4551,0.0,"i bought two suits off the peg, three shirts, two pairs of shoes."
4552,0.0,"you should have seen me, trying on trousers, pointing at this and that."
4553,1.2000000000000002,"i was completely convincing."""
4554,0.0,"he sat back in his chair, one arm sprawled across the kitchen table, his suit jacket neatly swelled by impacted muscle, not a crease in view."
4555,0.9,he looked like one of the young professionals beginning to infiltrate our neighbourhood.

4597,0.0,so.
4598,0.25,my first task was to find the best possible likeness of peter gorringe.
4599,1.1,"i went on the website of his and miranda's old school, found the year photographs and there he was, a great lump in the back row."
4600,0.6,"i found him again in the school magazine, in articles about the rugby and cricket seasons."
4601,0.0,"then, of course, the press coverage during the trial."
4602,1.1,"a lot of head-under-the-blanket, but i found some useful shots and merged what i had into a composite, high-definition portrait and scanned it."

4696,1.55,"all well and good, and no surprises."
4697,0.75,"the speech was long, partly because each of benn's proposals was met with reverential applause."

4727,0.0,the couple were no more than twenty feet away.
4728,-0.8,"i raised a hand and called out ridiculously, ""i say ."
4729,-0.5,they might not have heard; my words could have been lost to benn's speech.
4730,0.0,i felt adam's hand on my shoulder.

4744,-0.6,"just before they disappeared from view, she turned for one last look."
4745,0.0,she was too far away for me to read her expression.
4746,-0.6,she was no more than a small pale face bobbing in the press of bodies.
4747,0.0,then she was gone.
4748,0.0,we could have followed them but adam had already turned in the other direction and had gone to stand by the oak tree.
4749,0.0,we set off for home in silence.
4750,1.0,i should have done more to encourage him to approach his twin.
4751,-0.6,we stood side by side on the crowded tube heading south.
4752,-1.75,"i was haunted, and i knew he was too, by eve's abject look."
4753,0.0,i decided not to press him to explain why he had turned away.

4770,-0.8,"in the mid-morning of the following day, when the rain had stopped at last, i went into my bedroom and persuaded adam to desert the currency markets and come for a walk."
4771,-0.5,he was just back from escorting miranda to the tube and reluctantly got to his feet.

4889,-0.4,a taxi stopped for me.
4890,0.25,"out of politeness, i got in and rode an expensive 300 yards home."
4891,0.0,"that evening, i asked miranda if her father knew about adam."
4892,0.5,"she had told him, she said, but he was not much interested."
4893,0.5,so why was she so keen to take adam to salisbury?
4894,0.0,"because, she explained as we lay in bed, she wanted to see what happened between them."
4895,-0.25,she thought her father needed a full-on encounter with the twentieth century.
4896,-1.4,"a rock climber who had read a thousand times as many books as i had, a man who did not ""tolerate fools gladly""--with my limited literary background i should have been intimidated, but now the decision was made, i was looking forward to shaking his hand."
4897,0.4,i was immune.
4898,1.35,"his daughter and i were in love, and maxfield had to take me as i was."
4899,1.2000000000000002,"besides, lunch at miranda's childhood home, a place i was keen to see, was merely the soft prelude to calling on gorringe, which i dreaded, regardless of adam's researches."
4900,0.6,we left the house after breakfast on a blustery wednesday morning.
4901,0.0,my car had no rear doors.
4902,-0.5,it surprised me that adam was so inept as he squeezed himself onto the back seat.
4903,0.0,the collar of his suit jacket became snared on a chrome plate that housed a seat-belt reel.
4904,0.9,"when i unhooked him, he seemed to think his dignity was compromised."
4905,-1.25,"as we began the long crawl through wandsworth he was moody, our reluctant backseat teenage son on a family outing."
4906,1.75,"in the circumstances, miranda was cheerful as she filled me in on her father's news: in and out of hospital for more tests; one health visitor replaced by another, at his insistence; his gout returning to his right thumb but not the left; his regrets for the stamina he lacked for all he wanted to write; his excitement at the novella he would soon finish."
4907,0.0,he wished he would discovered the form long before.
4908,0.30000000000000004,the new york apartment idea had been forgotten.
4909,0.0,he had plans for a trilogy after this one.
4910,0.050000000000000044,at miranda's feet was a canvas bag containing our lunch--he had told her that the new housekeeper was a terrible cook.

4912,-0.25,"after an hour, we were just beginning to escape london's gravitational pull."
4913,0.0,i appeared to be the only driver steering his degwn car.
4914,0.0,most people in what was once the driver's seat were asleep.
4915,0.95,"as soon as the money was in place for the notting hill house, i intended to buy myself a high-powered autonomous vehicle."
4916,0.75,miranda and i would drink wine on long journeys and watch movies and make love on the fold-down back seat.
4917,-0.1,"by the time i had allusively set out this scheme for her, we were passing the autumnal hedgerows of hampshire."
4918,-1.35,there seemed something unnatural about the size of the trees that loomed over the road.
4919,0.35,"we had decided to make a detour past stonehenge, though i hoped it would not prompt adam to lecture us on its origins."
4920,0.4,but he was in no mood for talk.
4921,0.0,"when miranda asked him if he was unhappy, he murmured, ""i am fine, thank you."
4922,1.8,i began to wonder if he was ready to change his mind about calling on gorringe.
4923,-1.0,i would not object.
4924,-0.75,"if we did go, he might not, in his moody condition, be active enough in our defence."
4925,0.0,i glanced at him in the rear-view mirror.
4926,0.0,his head was turned to his left to watch the fields and clouds.
4927,0.0,i thought i saw his lips moving
4928,0.0,but i could not be sure.
4929,0.0,when i glanced again his lips were still.
4930,-0.75,"in fact, it troubled me when we passed stonehenge without a commentary."
4931,1.0,he was silent too after we crossed the plain and caught our first view of the cathedral spire.
4932,0.0,miranda and i exchanged a look.
4933,-1.0,but we forgot about him for a tetchy twenty minutes as we tried to find her house in salisbury's one-way system.
4934,-0.25,this was her home town and she would not tolerate the satnav.
4935,-0.75,but her mental map of the city was a pedestrian's and all her instructions were wrong.
4936,-1.0,"after some sweaty you-turns in disobliging traffic and reversing up a one-way street, narrowly avoiding a quarrel, we parked a couple of hundred yards from her family home."
4937,0.0,the downturn in our mood appeared to refresh adam.
4938,0.0,"as soon as we were on the pavement, he insisted on taking the heavy canvas bag from me."
4939,0.75,"we were close to the cathedral, not quite within the precinct, but the house was imposing enough to have been the perk of some grand ecclesiastical."
4940,0.5,adam was the first with a bright hello when the housekeeper opened the door.
4941,1.0,"she was a pleasant, competent-looking woman in her forties."
4942,-0.25,it was hard to believe that she could not cook.
4943,0.4,she led us into the kitchen.
4944,1.25,"adam lifted the bag onto a deal table, then he looked around and banged his hands together and said, ""weill marvellous."
4945,0.65,the housekeeper led us up to the first floor to maxfield's study.
4946,0.0,the room was as large as anything in elgin crescent.
4947,-1.5,"floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on three sides, three sets of library steps, three tall sash windows overlooking the street, a leather-topped desk dead centre with two reading lamps, and behind the desk an orthopaedic chair packed with pillows and among them, sitting upright, fountain pen in hand and glaring across at us in focussed irritation as we were ushered in, was maxfield blacke, whose jaw was so tightly clenched it seemed his teeth might break."
4948,0.5,then his features relaxed.
4949,0.75,a good one.
4950,0.0,"why do not you all bugger off for half an hour?"""
4951,0.0,"miranda was crossing the room. """
4952,-1.0,"do not be pretentious, daddy."
4953,0.0,"we have been driving for three hours."""
4954,1.25,"her last few words were muffled within their embrace, which lasted a good while."
4955,0.0,maxfield had put his pen down and was murmuring into his daughter's ear.
4956,0.0,"she was on one knee, with her arms around his neck."
4957,-0.6,the housekeeper had disappeared.
4958,-0.75,"it felt uncomfortable to be watching, so i shifted my gaze to the pen."
4959,-0.5,"it lay, nib exposed, next to many sheets of unlined paper spread across the desk and covered by tiny handwriting."
4960,0.5,"from where i stood, i could see that there were no crossings-out, or arrows or bubbles or additions down the perfectly formed margins."
4961,0.0,"i also had time to observe that apart from the desk lamps, there were no other devices in the room, not even a telephone or a typewriter."
4962,0.0,only the book titles perhaps and the author's chair declared that it was not 1890.
4963,0.0,that date did not seem so far away.
4964,0.0,miranda made the introductions.
4965,0.25,"adam, still in his strange, genial mode, went first."
4966,-1.0,then it was my turn to approach and shake his hand.
4967,0.0,"maxfield said unsmilingly, ""i have heard a lot about you from miranda."
4968,0.6,i am looking forward to a chat.
4969,0.0,"as i spoke, he grimaced."
4970,0.30000000000000004,i appeared to have fulfilled some negative expectation.
4971,0.0,"he looked far older than his photograph in the profile, published five years before."
4972,-1.5,"it was a narrow face, whose skin was thinly stretched, as though from too much snarling or angry staring."
4973,-0.4,miranda had told me that among his generation there was a certain style of irascible scepticism.
4974,0.0,"you had to ride it out, she told me, because beneath it was playfulness."
4975,0.75,"what they wanted, she said, was for you to push back, and be clever about it."
4976,0.5,"now, as maxfield released my hand, i thought i might be capable of pushing back."
4977,-0.25,as for being clever--i froze.
4978,0.0,"the housekeeper, christine, came in with a tray of sherry."
4979,0.6,"adam said, ""not for now, thanks."""
4980,-0.19999999999999996,he helped christine fetch three wooden chairs from the corners of the room and set them out in a shallow curve facing the desk.
4981,0.75,"when we three were holding our drinks, maxfield said to miranda, gesturing towards me, ""does he like sherry?"""
4982,1.15,"she in turn looked at me and i said, ""well enough, thanks."
4983,1.25,in fact i did not like it at all and wondered whether it would have been clever in miranda's sense to have said so.
4984,0.20000000000000007,"she set about asking her father a set of routine questions about his various pains, his medication, the hospital food, an elusive specialist, a new sleeping pill."
4985,2.1,"it was hypnotic, listening to her, the sweetly dutiful daughter."
4986,1.55,her voice was sensible and loving.
4987,0.25,she reached over and brushed back fine strands of hair where they floated across his forehead.
4988,0.5,he answered her like an obedient schoolboy.
4989,-1.5,"when one of her questions prompted a memory of some frustration or medical incompetence and he became restive, she soothed him and stroked his arm."
4990,-0.050000000000000044,this invalid catechism soothed me too; my love for miranda swelled.
4991,0.75,"it had been a long drive, the thick sweet sherry was a balm."
4992,0.5,perhaps i liked it after all.
4993,0.0,my eyes closed and it was an effort to open them again.
4994,0.0,i did so just in time to hear maxfield blacke's question.
4995,-1.0,he was no longer the querulous valetudinarian.
4996,0.5,his question was barked out like a command.
4997,0.1,"what books have you been reading lately?"""
4998,-0.75,there was no worse question he could have asked me.

5000,0.75,"the evening before, i would been absorbed by an article in an electronics trade journal."
5001,0.0,i had no habit with books.
5002,0.6,"as my days raced by, i found no space within them to be in an armchair, idly turning pages."
5003,-0.25,"i would have made something up, but my mind was empty."
5004,0.0,the last book in my hand was one of miranda's corn law histories.
5005,0.0,i read the title on the spine and passed it back to her.
5006,-0.5,"i would forgotten nothing, for there was nothing to remember."

5455,0.8,"you see, peter, i am here to learn."

5462,0.0,or did you run?
5463,-0.25,when you got home did you wash your cock?
5464,0.0,hygiene might not be your thing.

5470,0.75,still good for you?
5471,0.0,you see what i am getting at.
5472,0.75,i need to know what pleased you about the entire experience.
5473,-0.5,if you got a thrill not just out of raping her

5475,0.0,"and one more--"""
5476,0.0,"in a loping movement, gorringe was out of his chair at speed and bending towards miranda with his arm swinging in a wide arc towards her face."
5477,0.0,i had time to see that his hand was open.
5478,-1.5,"it was going to be a slap, an extremely hard one, far more violent than the sort men in movies once gave to women to bring them to their senses."
5479,0.0,i had barely begun to lift my own hand in her defence when adam's rose to intercept and close around gorringe's wrist.
5480,0.7,the deflected sweep of his fastmoving arm provided the momentum that smoothly swung adam to his feet.
5481,-1.0,"gorringe dropped to his knees, just as i had, with his captured hand twisted above his head and about to be crushed, while adam stood over him."
5482,-0.5,it was a tableau of agony.

5484,0.0,"still maintaining the pressure, adam forced the young man back to his chair and, as soon as he was seated, released him."
5485,0.25,so we sat in silence for several minutes as gorringe nursed his arm against his chest.
5486,-0.75,i knew that pain.
5487,-0.5,"as i remembered, i had made more fuss."
5488,0.0,he had appearances to keep up.

5493,1.0,we were waiting for him to recover.

5495,0.0,"this was what she had come here for, to see him, to really see him."
5496,0.0,but now what?
5497,-0.30000000000000004,she surely doubted there was anything meaningful that gorringe could tell her.
5498,-2.65,he suffered the failure of imagination that afflicted and enabled all rapists.
5499,-1.25,"when his weight was on mariam, when she was pinned to the grass, when she was in his arms, he failed to imagine her fear."
5500,-0.25,even as he saw and heard and smelled it.
5501,-1.75,the lifting curve of his arousal was not troubled by the idea of her terror.
5502,0.9,"at that moment, she may as well have been a sex doll, a device, a machine."
5503,-0.35,or--i had gorringe completely wrong.
5504,1.0,i had the mirror image of the truth.
5505,-0.44999999999999996,i was the one with the failed imagination: gorringe knew the state of mind of his victim all too well.
5506,2.55,"he entered her misery and thrilled to it, and it was precisely this triumph of imagining, of frenzied empathy, that drove his excitement into an exalted form of sexual hatred."
5507,-0.75,i did not know which was worse or whether there was some sense in which both could be true.
5508,0.0,they seemed mutually exclusive to me.

5512,1.5,"to us he was illuminated like a figure on a stage and it seemed appropriate when he, not miranda, started to speak."
5513,1.9,he pressed his right hand against his chest with his left as though taking a vow of honesty.
5514,0.0,he had dropped the thuggish tone.
5515,-1.35,"pain at this level was a tranquilliser, an enforcer, stripping the affectation out, coaxing his voice back to that of the undergraduate he might have become without miranda's intervention."
5516,-1.0,he was in for armed robbery.
5517,-0.75,the prison was shortstaffed so we were often locked up together for twenty-three hours a day.
5518,0.8,this was right at the beginning of my term.
5519,0.5,"the worst time, everyone says, the first few months, when you do not accept where you are"
5520,-0.55,"and you can not stop thinking about what you could have been doing and how you are going to get out, and getting your appeal together and getting angry with the solicitor because nothing seems to be happening."
5521,0.0,i mean fights.
5522,-1.25,i hey told me i had anger problems
5523,0.8,and they were right.
5524,0.0,i thought because i was six two and played rugby in the second row i could look after myself.
5525,-0.75,that was crap.
5526,-0.8,i knew nothing about real fighting.
5527,-1.0,i got my throat slashed and could have died.
5528,-1.0,"i hated his whistling, his stinking teeth, his press-ups and jumping jacks."

5531,-0.5,but i hated you ten times more.
5532,-1.65,i used to lie on my bunk and burn with hatred.
5533,0.0,hours on end.

5537,-2.25,i just thought you were one of those spiteful man-hating bitches or you woke up the next morning and felt ashamed of yourself and decided to take it out on me.

5539,1.1,i was going to save up the money and get someone to do the business for me.
5540,0.0,brian got out.
5541,1.1,i was moved a couple of times and things began to settle into a kind of routine when the days are all the same and time begins to go faster.

5552,0.0,possibly gorringe feared what adam might yet do to him.

5561,-0.5,it started out as a bit of a scam.

5563,0.0,it was guided from the start.
5564,0.0,the rules were you could get more time out of your cell if you came on as all religious.
5565,0.0,a lot of us were on to it and the screws understood
5566,1.0,but they did not care.
5567,0.1,i put myself down as church of england and started going every day to evensong.

5569,-0.19999999999999996,at first it was boring but better than the cell.
5570,-1.0,then a little less boring.
5571,0.0,then i started to get drawn in.
5572,1.25,"it was the vicar mostly, at least at the beginning, the reverend wilfred murray, a big fellow with a liverpool accent."
5573,0.0,"he was not scared of anyone, and that was something in a place like that."
5574,0.5,he started taking an interest in me when he saw i was serious.
5575,0.0,he sometimes dropped by my cell.
5576,0.8,"he gave me passages to read from the bible, mostly from the new testament."
5577,0.0,after evensong on thursdays he would go through them with me and a few others.
5578,0.0,i never thought i would find myself volunteering for a bible-study group.
5579,0.75,"and it was not for the benefit of the parole board, the way it was for some."
5580,-0.35,"but the more i became aware of god's presence in my life, the worse i felt about mariam."
5581,0.85,"i understood from reverend murray that i had a mountain to climb in coming to terms with what i would done, that forgiveness was a long way off but that i could work towards it."

5591,-1.0,"so, revenge."
5592,0.5,i almost admired you for it.
5593,1.0,you were brilliant in court.

5650,0.0,"there was no question, this was a visceral response."
5651,-0.75,but i was sure she had the door open before she started to be sick.

5653,0.0,"instead, the contents of her stomach, the colourful buffet lunch, lay thickly over the hall carpet and the threshold."

5670,-0.6,"once we were home, my thoughts remained dark."
5671,0.0,i slumped in the kitchen armchair with a mug of tea.
5672,-0.25,i did not yet dare confide my feelings to miranda.
5673,-0.4,"i had to admit it, at that moment i resented her, especially her old habit of secrecy."

5675,0.0,"i would have to tell her, but not now."
5676,-0.55,"an argument was bound to follow, and i did not have the strength."

5678,-0.5,"or: withdrawing, we would each go too far and, like inept trapezists, slip out of each other's grasp and fall and, as we nursed our injuries, slowly become strangers."
5679,0.0,i surveyed these possibilities dispassionately.
5680,-2.75,"even a third path did not trouble me much: i would lose her, regret it bitterly and never get her back, however hard i tried."

5724,0.0,we could decorate and carpet it.
5725,-0.5,we need not trouble the landlord.
5726,0.8,"when it was time to move to the new place, we would put everything back."

5950,0.0,there was ps30 on the desk.
5951,0.0,i put it in my pocket and thought no more of it.

5973,-0.6,"then a resonating thump, as of a leap from a high place that made the ceiling-light fittings rattle and some plaster dust fall onto my arm."

5997,-0.25,"he stood with an elbow resting on my knee, fiddling with the edge of tinfoil he needed to remove."
5998,0.0,he looked up.
5999,0.0,"the accent was still the generalised cockney of london and its surrounds, but there was another element, some undertones inflecting the vowels."
6000,0.0,"something of miranda's, i thought."
6001,0.0,he put the carton in my hands.
6002,0.0,i opened it for him and handed it back.

6039,-0.75,"she said, ""we were beginning to worry about you."""
6040,-0.75,he was still in his moment of immediate abandon.
6041,-0.5,i had sometimes wondered if the charge was like slaking a desperate thirst.
6042,1.0,"he had told me that in those first seconds it was a gorgeous surge, a breaking wave of clarity that settled into deep contentment."

6078,0.0,it hardly mattered.
6079,0.75,the question was merely a friendly gesture and adam was retreating into his version of sleep.
6080,0.25,"he had described it to me variously; he did not dream, he ""wandered."""
6081,1.25,"he sorted and rearranged his files, reclassified memories from short to long term, played out internal conflicts in disguised form, usually without resolving them, reanimated old material in order to refresh it, and moved, so he put it once, in a trance through the garden of his thoughts."
6082,-1.0499999999999998,"in such a state he conducted in relative slow motion his researches, formulated tentative decisions, and even wrote new haikus or discarded or reimagined old ones."
6083,2.5,"he also practised what he called the art of feeling, allowing himself the luxury of the entire spectrum from grief to joy, so that all emotion remained accessible to him when fully charged."
6084,1.9500000000000002,"it was, above all else, he insisted, a process of repair and consolidation from which he emerged daily, delighted to find himself to be, once again, self-aware, in a state of grace--his word and to reclaim the consciousness that the very nature of matter permitted."

6415,0.1,"renewal, they call it."
6416,-0.75,"i hate the idea, just as you would."
6417,0.0,"i want to be what i am, what i was."
6418,0.0,so i have this request...
6419,0.5,if you would be so kind.
6420,0.0,before they come . . .
6421,0.0,hide my body.
6422,0.0,tell them i ran off.
6423,0.30000000000000004,your refund is forfeited anyway.
6424,-0.75,i have disabled the tracking program.
6425,0.0,"hide my body from them, and then, when they have gone ..."
6426,1.55,i would like you to take me to your friend sir alan turing.
6427,2.0,i love his work and admire him deeply.
6428,0.0,"he might make some use of me, or of some part of me."""
6429,0.0,now the pauses between each fading phrase were longer.
6430,1.25,"miranda, let me say one last time i love you, and thank you."
6431,0.0,"charlie, miranda, my first and dearest friends ."
6432,0.0,my entire being is stored elsewhere ...
6433,0.0,so i know i will always remember . . .
6434,0.5,hope you will listen to ...
6435,0.0,to one last seventeen-syllable poem.
6436,-0.75,it owes a debt to philip larkin.
6437,0.0,but it is not about leaves and trees.
6438,1.0,it is about machines like me and people like you and our future together . . .
6439,-0.5,the sadness that is to come.
6440,0.0,it will happen.
6441,0.8,with improvements over time .
6442,0.4,we will surpass you . . .
6443,0.0,and outlast you .
6444,0.75,"believe me, these lines express no triumph . . ."
6445,-0.75,"only regret."""
6446,0.0,he paused.
6447,-1.3,the words came with difficulty and were faint.
6448,0.0,we leaned across the table to listen.
6449,-0.65,"come spring we will renew, but you, alas, fall once."""
6450,-2.25,"then the pale blue eyes with their tiny black rods turned milky green, his hands curled by jerks into fists, and with a smooth humming sound, he lowered his head onto the table."
6451,1.2,your immediate duty was to introduce maxfield to the notion that i was not a robot and that i was going to marry his daughter.
6452,0.8,"i thought my true nature would be a revelation, but he was only mildly surprised and the adjustment, over champagne at a stone table on the lawn, was minimal."
6453,-0.15000000000000002,he admitted he had grown used to getting things wrong.
6454,0.0,"this, he told us, was one more forgettable instance in ageing's long dusk."
6455,1.1,"i said that no apology was in order, and by his expression i saw that he agreed."
6456,1.4,"after some thought, while she and i strolled to the bottom of the garden and back, he said he considered miranda, at twenty-three, too young to be married"
6457,-0.25,and we should wait.
6458,0.0,we said we could not.
6459,0.75,we were too much in love.
6460,-0.5,he poured another round and waved the tiresome matter away.
6461,0.0,that evening he gave us ps25.
6462,0.6,"since this was all we had to spend, we invited no friends or family to the ceremony at marylebone town hall."
6463,0.0,"only mark came, with jasmin."
6464,1.2,"she had found for him in a charity shop a scaled-down dark suit, white dress shirt and bow tie."
6465,1.9000000000000001,"he looked more like a miniature adult than a child, but all the sweeter for that."
6466,0.0,"afterwards, we four ate in a pizza place round the corner in baker street."
6467,1.35,"now that we were married and settled, jasmin thought our adoption prospects were good."
6468,0.5,we showed mark how to raise his lemonade and clink glasses in a toast to a successful outcome.
6469,0.8,"it all went off well, but miranda and i could only pretend to be joyous."
6470,0.5,gorringe had been arrested two weeks before and that was excellent.
6471,0.0,we could privately raise another glass.
6472,1.9000000000000004,"but that day, on the morning of our wedding, she had received a courteous letter suggesting she make herself available for questioning at a certain salisbury police station."
6473,0.0,"two days later, i drove her to her appointment."
6474,0.8,"some honeymoon, we joked along the way."
6475,-0.5,but we were wretched.
6476,-0.65,"she went in and i waited in the car, outside a new concrete building of brutalist design, fretting that without a lawyer she could make deeper trouble for herself."
6477,0.0,after two hours she emerged from the revolving doors of the modernist blockhouse.
6478,0.0,i watched closely through the windscreen as she approached.
6479,0.25,"she looked seriously ill, like a cancer patient, and flat-footed, like an old person."
6480,0.25,the questioning had been close and tough.
6481,0.5,"the decision to charge her with perjury or perverting the course of justice or both had been referred upwards through police hierarchies, and on higher, or wider, to the director of public prosecutions."
6482,-0.6999999999999998,a lawyer friend told us later that the dpp would have to decide whether pursuing the case would deter genuine rape victims from coming forward.
6483,1.0,"two months later, in january, she was charged with perverting the course of justice."
6484,0.85,we needed legal representation and had no money.
6485,1.25,our application for legal aid was turned down.
6486,-0.5,social spending was being cut back hard.
6487,-0.09999999999999998,"the healey government was going ""cap in hand,"" as everyone said, to the international monetary fund for a loan."
6488,-1.0,the left of the party was outraged by the cuts.
6489,0.050000000000000044,there was talk of a general strike.
6490,-0.15000000000000002,miranda refused to approach her father for money.
6491,0.25,the cost of his support--and he was not rich--would be an undesirable excursion into truth.
6492,0.0,there was no alternative.
6493,-0.7000000000000001,"i prostrated myself before the bass player, who, barely troubling to reflect, handed back ps3,250 in cash, one half of my deposit."
6494,-0.19999999999999996,"in all our anguished conversations about adam, his personality, his morals, his motives, we returned often to the moment i brought the hammer down on his head."
6495,1.65,"for ease of reference, and to spare us too vivid a recall, we came to call it ""the deed."
6496,0.9,the spirit of the deed took various forms.
6497,0.8,"its least frightening shape was that of a sensible, even heroic move to keep miranda out of trouble and mark in our lives."
6498,-0.25,how were we to know that the material was already with the police?
6499,-0.8,"if i had not been so impetuous, if she had only deterred me with a look, we would have learned that adam had been to salisbury."
6500,0.85,his brain would not have been worth wrecking and we might have coaxed him back into the currency markets.
6501,0.55,or i would have been entitled to a full refund when they came to collect him in the afternoon.
6502,0.0,then we could have afforded a smaller place across the river.
6503,-0.5,now we were condemned to stay where we were.
6504,0.5,but these speculations were the protective she will.
6505,0.5,"i he truth was, we missed him."
6506,1.5,"the ghost's least attractive form was adam himself, the man whose final gentle words were without recrimination."
6507,0.9,"we tried, and sometimes half succeeded, in fending off the deed."
6508,-1.35,"we told ourselves that this was, after all, a machine; its consciousness was an illusion; it had betrayed us with inhuman logic."
6509,-0.5,but we missed him.
6510,1.0,we agreed that he loved us.
6511,-1.75,some nights the conversation was interrupted while miranda quietly cried.
6512,0.4,then we would have to visit again
6513,-0.25,"how we stuffed him with great difficulty into the cupboard in the hall and covered him with coats, tennis rackets and flattened cardboard boxes to disguise his human shape."
6514,-0.5,we lied as instructed to the people who came to collect him.
6515,-0.4,"on the brighter side, gorringe was questioned and charged with the rape of mariam malik."
6516,-0.55,"adam was correct in his calculations--from the beginning, apparently, it was gorringe's intention to plead guilty."
6517,0.0,he must have answered all the questions and given a full account of his actions that evening on the playing field.
6518,2.65,"by way of sincere belief in god's constant scrutiny and high regard for truth, gorringe knew that his only path to salvation was to confess."
6519,-0.25,or perhaps he acted on the advice of his lawyer.
6520,0.0,or both were in play.
6521,0.0,we would never know.
6522,-0.5,but we did know that god failed to protect gorringe from certain misfortunes of legal timing.
6523,-1.0,"with miranda's case not yet come to light, gorringe stood before the law with one rape already on his account."
6524,-1.2000000000000002,"when it came to sentencing, the judge assumed that he would have received a longer term for the assault on miranda had it been known that it was his second offence."
6525,-0.25,"no allowance, then, for the time he had already spent inside."
6526,-0.75,the judge was in her early fifties and represented a generational shift in attitudes to rape.
6527,-0.09999999999999998,"she made an implicit reference to the vodka bottle of the first case when she said that she did not believe that an unaccompanied young woman walking home at dusk was ""asking for trouble."
6528,0.0,miranda had made her statement and was not in court.
6529,0.0,"i was in the public gallery, sitting across from mariam's family."
6530,-1.0,"i could hardly bear to look their way, their radiating misery was so intense."
6531,-0.5,"when the judge handed down gorringe's eight-year sentence, i forced myself to look across at mariam's mother."
6532,-0.4,"she was openly crying, whether from relief or sorrow i would never know."
6533,0.0,miranda's case came round all too soon.
6534,2.9,"her barrister, lilian moore, competent, intelligent, charming, was a young woman from dun laoghaire."
6535,0.0,we met her in her chambers in gray's inn.
6536,-1.25,"i sat in a corner while she talked miranda out of a ""not guilty"" plea, her first impulse."
6537,-0.5,it was not difficult.
6538,-1.75,the prosecution was bound to make much of her recorded description of her revenge on gorringe.
6539,-0.75,"his statement, made from prison, dovetailed with hers."
6540,0.0,they were remembering the same evening.
6541,-1.0,"miranda's ""not guilty"" plea would bring a longer sentence in the likely event of a successful prosecution."
6542,-0.5,"and, of course, she dreaded a trial."
6543,-2.25,"a ""guilty"" plea was entered, though she tormented herself that she was somehow letting mariam down."
6544,-1.75,the april evening before she was due in court for sentencing was one of the strangest and saddest i have ever spent.
6545,0.0,lilian had told miranda from the beginning that a custodial sentence was likely.
6546,0.0,"she had packed a small suitcase and it stood by the door to our bedroom, a constant reminder."
6547,0.5,i brought out my only bottle of decent wine.
6548,0.0,"the word ""last"" kept occurring to me, though i could not mention it."
6549,0.0,"together we cooked a meal, perhaps a last meal."
6550,0.75,"when we raised a glass, it was not to her last evening of freedom, as i silently thought, but to mark."
6551,0.0,"she had been to see him that afternoon and told him she might have to be away for work for a while, and that i would be coming to see him and take him out for treats."
6552,-0.75,"he must have sensed there was some deeper meaning, some sorrow in this ""work."
6553,0.0,one of the helpers had to prise his fingers from her skirt.
6554,0.0,"during the meal, we tried to hold off an invading silence."
6555,0.5,we talked about the fiercely supportive women's groups who would be outside the old bailey the next morning.
6556,1.0,we told each other how marvellous lilian was.
6557,1.0,i reminded her of the judge's reputation for mildness.
6558,0.5,"but at every turn, the silence came in like a tide and to speak again was an effort."
6559,0.75,"when i said that it was as if she might be going into hospital tomorrow, the remark was not helpful."
6560,-0.5,"when i said i thought it was likely she would be eating with me at this table tomorrow night, that fell flat too."
6561,0.0,neither of us believed it.
6562,1.4,"earlier in the day, in a better frame of mind, somewhat defiant, we had thought we would make love after dinner."
6563,0.0,another last.
6564,0.10000000000000009,"now, in our sorrow, sex seemed like some long-abandoned pleasure, like playground skipping or dancing the twist."
6565,-0.25,"her suitcase stood guard, barring entrance to the bedroom."
6566,0.5499999999999997,"next day in court, lilian made a brilliant speech in mitigation, conjuring for the judge the closeness of the two young women, the brutality of the assault, the vow of silence that mariam had imposed on the accused, the traumatising shock of her dearest friend's suicide and miranda's sincere desire for justice."
6567,1.7000000000000002,"lilian referred to miranda's clean record, her recent marriage, her studies and, above all, her intended adoption of an underprivileged child."
6568,-0.5,"it was a statement in itself, a bleak one, that mariam's family were not in the public gallery."
6569,-0.5,"his honour's judgement was long, and i expected the worst."
6570,-1.5,"he emphasised miranda's careful planning, the cunning execution, the deliberate and sustained deception of the court."
6571,1.05,"he said that he accepted much of what lilian had said, and that he was being lenient when he sentenced miranda to serve one year."
6572,0.19999999999999996,"standing upright in the dock, in the business suit she had bought for the occasion, miranda appeared to freeze."
6573,1.5,i wanted her to look my way so that i could send her a sign of loving encouragement.
6574,0.0,but she was already locked up in her thoughts.
6575,-0.75,she told me later that at that moment she was confronting the implications of having a criminal record.
6576,0.0,she was thinking of mark.
6577,-1.9500000000000002,"until then, i would never considered what humiliation it was, to be taken down the courtroom steps and escorted to prison--by force if you tried to resist."
6578,-0.35,"her term began in holloway prison, six months after the deed."
6579,2.25,adam's luminous love had triumphed.
6580,0.10000000000000009,"gorringe now had a reasonable basis on which to appeal his sentence: one outrage, not two, and time already served."
6581,-0.25,but the law moved slowly.
6582,1.0,cheaper and more efficient dna testing was undermining all kinds of convictions.
6583,0.8,all kinds of self-declared innocent men and women were clamouring to have their cases reopened.
6584,0.6,there was a logjam at the appeal court.
6585,0.55,"gorringe, only partly innocent, would have to wait."
6586,0.4,"on miranda's first full day inside, i went to visit mark at his reception class in clapham old town."
6587,0.2,it was a single-storey prefabricated building by a victorian church.
6588,0.0,"as i walked up the path, passing under a heavily pollarded oak, i saw jasmin waiting for me by the entrance."
6589,0.6,"i knew straight away, and felt that i had always known."
6590,0.0,"her tight expression, as i came closer, was confirmation."
6591,-0.75,we had been refused.
6592,0.1,"she took me into the building and then, not into the classroom, but along a linoleum corridor to an office."
6593,-0.6,"as we passed, i saw mark through an interior window, standing at a low table with a few others, doing something with coloured wooden blocks."
6594,-0.5,"i sat with a cup of weak coffee while jasmin told me how sorry she was, how the matter was out of her hands, though she had done her best."
6595,0.0,we should have told her that there was a court case pending.
6596,1.0,she was investigating the appeal procedure.
6597,-0.4,"in the meantime, she had managed to get a single concession from the bureaucracy."
6598,0.4,"given the close attachment already formed, miranda would be allowed one audio-visual contact with mark each week."
6599,0.25,my attention was wandering.
6600,0.0,i did not need to hear any more.
6601,-0.25,i was thinking only of that point in the afternoon when i would break the news to miranda.
6602,0.0,"when jasmin was finished, i said i had nothing to ask or say."
6603,1.75,"we stood, she gave me a quick hug and led me out of the building by another corridor that avoided the classroom."
6604,-0.25,it was almost mid-morning break and mark had already been told i was not coming that day.
6605,0.0,"he might not have cared, for early season snow was falling and all the children were excited."
6606,-0.6,"the next day he would be told again that i was not coming, and the same the next day, and the next, until his expectations began to fade."
6607,-0.75,"miranda served six months, three in holloway, the rest in an open prison north of ipswich."
6608,0.09999999999999998,"like many middle-class, educated criminals before her, she put in for a job in the prison library."
6609,0.5,but a number of famous poll-tax martyrs were still waiting for their release.
6610,0.6,"in both prisons, the library posts were already filled and there was a waiting list."
6611,0.6,"in holloway, she took a course in industrial cleaning."
6612,0.85,"in suffolk, she worked in the nursery."
6613,-0.75,babies under one year were allowed to stay with their prisoner mothers.
6614,-1.65,"in my first few visits to holloway, it seemed to me that to lock someone up in this victorian monstrosity, or in any building, was a form of slow torture."
6615,-1.2999999999999998,"the bright visiting room, its child art on the walls, the companionable plastic tables, the haze of tobacco smoke, the din of voices and wailing babies, were a front for institutional horror."
6616,-0.25,but i was guiltily surprised by how quickly i became used to having my wife in prison.
6617,-0.75,i accustomed myself to her misery.
6618,0.6,another surprise was maxfield's equanimity.
6619,0.0,"there was no avoiding it, miranda had to tell him the entire story."
6620,0.3500000000000001,"he applauded the motives for her crime, and just as easily accepted her punishment."
6621,0.25,he had spent a year in wandsworth in 1942 as a conscientious objector.
6622,-0.5,holloway did not trouble him.
6623,0.75,"while miranda was in london, the housekeeper brought him to see her twice a week and, according to miranda, was good company."
6624,-0.4,we visitors were a community within which the incarceration of a loved one became a mere inconvenience.
6625,2.0,"as we queued to be searched and checked in and out, we chatted cheerfully, too cheerfully, about our particular circumstances."
6626,0.0,"i belonged in a band of husbands, boyfriends, children, middle-aged parents."
6627,-0.6,most of us colluded in the view that we and the women we were visiting did not belong here at all.
6628,-1.0,it was a misfortune we learned to tolerate.
6629,-1.0,"some of miranda's sister-inmates looked frightening, born to give and receive punishment."
6630,0.5,i would not have been as resilient as she was.
6631,-0.25,"to conduct a conversation in the visitors' room, we sometimes had to double down and concentrate hard to shut out exchanges between people on our table."
6632,-3.5,"blame, threats, abuse, with ""fuck"" and its variants at every turn."
6633,0.0,but there were always couples who mutely held hands and stared at each other.
6634,-0.75,i guessed they were in shock.
6635,1.5,"when the session was over, i felt bad about my little surge of joy as i stepped outside into the clean london air of personal freedom."
6636,-0.19999999999999996,"for the final week of miranda's incarceration, i travelled to ipswich and slept on the living-room sofa of an old school friend."
6637,0.5,it was the time of an exceptional indian summer.
6638,-1.0,i drove the fifteen miles each late afternoon to the open prison.
6639,0.25,"by the time i arrived, miranda would be finishing work."
6640,0.0,we sat on the grass in the shade by the reeds of a choked-up ornamental pond.
6641,0.8,here it was easy to forget that she was not free.
6642,-1.25,her weekly calls with mark had continued over the months and she worried desperately about him.
6643,0.0,"he was closing up, he was slipping away from her."
6644,1.25,she was convinced that adam had helped bring the case against her in order to ruin her adoption prospects.
6645,-0.75,"he was always jealous of mark, she insisted."
6646,2.35,adam was not designed to understand what it was to love a child.
6647,-0.19999999999999996,the concept of play was alien to him.
6648,-1.5,"i was sceptical, but i heard her out and did not argue, not at this stage."
6649,-0.75,i understood her bitterness.
6650,2.5,"my unspoken view, which she would not have liked, was that adam was designed for goodness and truth."
6651,-1.25,he would be incapable of executing a cynical plan.
6652,-1.3,"our appeal was delayed, partly because of illness, partly because the adoption agency was being radically reorganised."
6653,0.0,it was not until miranda was moved from holloway that the process officially began.
6654,2.1,there was a chance we could persuade the authorities that her criminal record was not relevant to the care she could provide.
6655,0.75,we had a good testimonial from jasmin.
6656,0.0,"during the summer, i was drawn into the kind of labyrinthine bureaucracy i would have associated with the declining ottoman empire."
6657,-1.5,it depressed me to hear that mark had behavioural problems.
6658,0.4,"tantrums, bed-wetting, general naughtiness."
6659,-0.5,"according to jasmin, he had been teased and bullied."
6660,0.0,he no longer danced or flitted about.
6661,0.4,there was no talk of princesses.
6662,0.0,i did not pass this on to miranda.
6663,1.25,she would been consulting local maps and had a clear idea of what she wanted on her first day of freedom.
6664,1.25,"the morning i collected her, the weather was beginning to turn and a cool strong wind was blowing from the east."
6665,0.0,"we drove to manningtree, parked in a lay-by and set out on the raised footpath that follows the tidal river stour to the sea."
6666,0.0,the weather hardly mattered.
6667,0.85,what she had wanted and found was open space and a big sky.
6668,0.0,it was low tide and the vast mudflats sparkled in intermittent sunshine.
6669,0.5,tiny bright clouds raced across a deep blue sky.
6670,0.0,miranda skipped along the dyke and kept punching the air.
6671,1.1,"we walked six miles before lunch, which i would prepared as a picnic, at her request."
6672,0.6,to eat it we needed to get out of the wind.
6673,0.4,"we came away from the river to shelter against a barn of corrugated iron, with a view of coils of rusting barbed wire partially submerged in beds of nettles."
6674,0.0,but that did not matter.
6675,1.4,"she was joyful, animated, full of plans."
6676,1.4,"i would been keeping it from her as a surprise, and now i told her that during her time inside i would saved almost ps1,000."
6677,1.25,"she was impressed, delighted, and she hugged and kissed me."
6678,0.0,then she was suddenly serious.
6679,-0.75,i hate him.
6680,0.0,"i want him out of the flat."""
6681,-0.09999999999999998,"adam remained concealed in the cupboard in the hall, just as we had left him following the deed."
6682,0.0,i had not carried out his final request.
6683,-1.1,he was too heavy and awkward for me to lift alone
6684,0.0,and i did not want to ask for help.
6685,-1.75,i felt both guilt and resentment and tried not to think about him.
6686,-0.25,the wind shook the barn's roof and made a booming sound.
6687,0.75,i took her hand and made my promise.
6688,0.0,"but we did not, not immediately."
6689,0.0,"when we arrived home, there was a letter for us on the doormat."
6690,0.95,it was an apology for the slowness of the appeal process.
6691,0.0,"our case was under further review, and we would hear a decision very soon."
6692,0.0,jasmin--very much on our side--sent a neutral note.
6693,0.6,she did not want to get our hopes up.
6694,-0.25,"over the months, it had sometimes seemed to go our way, other times it looked like a lost because."
6695,-1.25,against us: it was bureaucratically inefficient to make an exception to the rule--a criminal record nullified an adoption request.
6696,1.75,"for us: jasmin's reference, our heartfelt statements, and mark's love for miranda."
6697,0.0,i had not yet made it into his cast of significant adults.
6698,-0.5,"we were man and wife, together again in our own strange alignment of two tiny flats."
6699,0.5,we were in a mood to celebrate.
6700,0.0,"what were we doing, eating dry cheese sandwiches by a collapsing barn when here we had wine, lovemaking and a chicken to defrost?"
6701,0.0,"the day after we came back, we had friends round for a homecoming party."
6702,-0.25,"the next day we spent sleeping, then clearing up and sleeping again."
6703,1.35,"the day after that, i set about earning some money, though with minimal success."
6704,1.25,miranda put her academic work in order and went to the university to re-register for her course.
6705,1.75,"her freedom still amazed her: privacy and relative silence, and small things, like walking from one room to another, opening her wardrobe to find her clothes, going to the fridge to take what she wanted, stepping unchallenged into the street."
6706,-0.09999999999999998,an afternoon with the college bureaucracy diminished the elation somewhat.
6707,-0.25,"by the next morning, she was beginning to feel back in the world and the inert presence in the hallway cupboard oppressed her, just as it had in prospect."
6708,-0.4,"she said that whenever she passed near, she felt a radioactive presence."
6709,0.0,i understood.
6710,0.0,i sometimes felt the same.
6711,0.4,it took half a day on the phone to arrange a visit to the king's cross lab.
6712,0.35,it so happened that my appointment would fall on the day we were expecting the final decision on our appeal.
6713,0.0,we would been told we would hear by midday.
6714,0.0,i rented a van for twenty-four hours.
6715,0.25,"under my bed, jammed against the skirting board, was the disposable stretcher that had come with my purchase."
6716,0.6,i took it into the garden and dusted it down.
6717,-0.25,"miranda said she did not want to be involved in the removal, but there was no way round it."
6718,0.0,i needed her help carrying him to the van.
6719,0.0,"before that, i thought that i could get him out of the cupboard unaided and drag him onto the stretcher while she remained in our study, working on an essay."
6720,-0.6,"when i opened the cupboard door for the first time in nearly a year, i realised that just below the level of conscious expectation, i would been anticipating a putrefying stench."
6721,0.3500000000000001,"there was no good reason, i told myself, for my pulse rate to rise as i pulled away the tennis and squash rackets and the first of the coats."
6722,0.0,now his left ear was visible.
6723,0.0,i stepped back.
6724,-1.5,"it was not a murder, this was not a corpse."
6725,-1.25,my visceral repulsion was born of hostility.
6726,-3.25,"he had abused our hospitality, betrayed his own declared love, inflicted misery and humiliation on miranda, loneliness on me and deprivation on mark."
6727,1.2,i no longer felt sanguine about the appeal.
6728,-0.5,i dragged an old winter coat from across adam's shoulders.
6729,-0.09999999999999998,"i could see the dent on the top of his head, beneath the dark hair, which gleamed with artificial life."
6730,0.0,next to come away was a skiing jacket.
6731,0.0,now his head and shoulders were revealed.
6732,0.5,"it was a relief that his eyes were closed, though i did not remember lowering the lids."
6733,0.65,"here was his dark suit, beneath it the clean white shirt with rolled button-down collar, as crisp as if he had put it on an hour before."
6734,0.0,these were his going-away clothes.
6735,0.0,when he believed he was leaving us to meet his maker.
6736,-0.30000000000000004,"a faint scent of refined instrument oil had accumulated in the confined space, and once more i recalled my father's sax."
6737,-0.15000000000000002,"how far bebop had travelled, from the wild basements of manhattan to the stifling constraints of my childhood."
6738,-0.75,irrelevant.
6739,0.0,i pulled away a blanket and the last of the coats.
6740,-0.09999999999999998,now he was fully exposed.
6741,0.0,"he sat wedged sideways, with his back to the side of the cupboard, knees drawn up."
6742,0.8,he resembled a man who had drifted to the bottom of a dry well.
6743,-0.5,hard not to think he was biding his time.
6744,-0.25,"his black shoes shone, the laces were tied, both hands rested in his lap."
6745,0.0,had i placed them there?
6746,0.0,his complexion was unchanged.
6747,0.75,he looked healthy.
6748,0.8,"in repose, the face was thoughtful rather than cruel."
6749,-0.5,i was reluctant to touch him.
6750,-1.75,"as i put a hand on his shoulder, i tentatively said his name, and then again, as if i was trying to keep a hostile dog at bay."
6751,0.25,"my plan was to topple him towards me, then ease him out of the cupboard onto the stretcher."
6752,1.0,"i cupped my free hand round his neck, which seemed warm to the touch, and pulled him over, onto his side."
6753,-0.25,"before he hit the cupboard floor, i caught him in an awkward embrace."
6754,-1.0,this was a dead weight.
6755,0.0,the fabric of his suit jacket became bunched up against my face as i lowered him.
6756,-1.5,"i got my hands into his armpits and, with immense difficulty and much grunting, twisted him onto his back while dragging him from his confinement."
6757,0.8,not easy.
6758,-0.5,"the jacket was tight and silky, my grip was poor."
6759,-0.4,the legs remained bent.
6760,-0.25,"a form of rigor mortis, perhaps."
6761,-0.75,i thought i might be doing damage
6762,1.0,but i was beginning not to care.
6763,0.0,"i pulled him out, inches at a time, and rolled him onto the stretcher."
6764,0.0,i straightened his legs by pushing down on his knees with my foot.
6765,1.35,"for mirandas benefit, i covered him, face included, with the blanket."
6766,0.5,enough magical thought.
6767,0.5,my attitude now was brisk.
6768,0.0,"i went outside to open up the van doors, then fetched miranda."
6769,0.0,"when she saw the covered form, she shook her head."
6770,0.8,"better to uncover his face and tell people it is a mannequin."""
6771,0.0,"but when i pulled the blanket off, she looked away."
6772,0.0,"we carried him out just as we had carried him in long ago, with me at the head."
6773,0.0,no one saw us as we slid the stretcher into the van.
6774,0.8,"i secured the doors, and as i turned she kissed me,"
6775,1.25,told me she loved me and wished me luck.
6776,0.0,she did not want to come with me.
6777,-0.25,she would stay at home and wait for the phone call from jasmin.
6778,0.0,"we had not heard anything by twelve thirty, so i set off."
6779,0.4,"i took my usual route towards vauxhall and waterloo bridge, but i was still a mile from the river and i was in heavy traffic."
6780,0.0,of course.
6781,-1.4500000000000002,our own concerns had obliterated the great event that was obsessing the entire nation.
6782,-0.35,"it was the long-awaited first day of the general strike and a huge demonstration, the biggest ever, was taking place in london today."
6783,0.0,division was everywhere.
6784,-0.75,half the trade union movement was against the strike.
6785,-1.25,half the government and half the opposition were against healey's decision not to leave the european union.
6786,-0.75,international lenders were imposing further spending cuts on a government that had promised to spend more.

6789,0.0,half the labour party membership wanted healey out.
6790,0.4,"some wanted a general election, others wanted their own man or woman in place."
6791,-0.7,"there were calls, derided here, applauded there, for a national government."
6792,-0.75,a state of emergency remained in place.
6793,-0.5,the economy had shrunk by five per cent in a year.
6794,-0.5,riots were as frequent as strikes.
6795,-0.6,inflation went on rising.
6796,-1.25,no one knew where such discontent and discord were taking us.
6797,-1.8,it had brought me to a potholed street by a line of shabby junk shops in vauxhall.
6798,0.0,gridlock.
6799,0.0,"while we were stationary, i phoned home."
6800,0.0,no news.
6801,0.6,"after waiting twenty minutes, i eased off the road and half mounted the pavement."
6802,0.0,"i would seen an item that might be of use, displayed outside along with piled desks, lamp stands and bed frames."
6803,0.09999999999999998,"it was a wheelchair of the minimal, upright, tubular-steel design once used in hospitals."
6804,-0.6499999999999999,"it was dented and grubby, with frayed security straps, but the wheels turned well enough and after some haggling, i paid ps2 for it."
6805,0.8,the junk-shop owner helped me lift what i told him was a water-filled mannequin out of the van and into the chair.
6806,0.0,he did not ask me what the water was for.
6807,0.0,i tightened the chest and waist security straps more forcefully than any sentient being could have tolerated.
6808,0.0,"i stowed the stretcher, locked the van and began the long trudge northwards."
6809,-0.75,the chair was as heavy as its burden and one wheel squeaked under the weight.
6810,-0.25,none of its fellows turned as easily as they had when the chair was empty.
6811,-1.1,"if the pavements had been deserted, it would have been hard enough, but they were as jammed as the roads."
6812,0.4,it was the usual conundrum--people were flowing away from the march just as thousands were surging towards it.
6813,0.0,"at the slightest incline, i had to double my efforts."
6814,0.0,i crossed the river at vauxhall bridge and passed by the tate gallery.
6815,0.0,"by the time i reached parliament square and was starting along whitehall, the front wheels began to tighten against their axles."
6816,0.0,i was grunting at each step with the effort.
6817,-1.25,"i imagined myself as a servant in pre-industrial times, transporting my impassive lord to his leisured appointment, where i would wait, thankless, to carry him back."
6818,-0.5,i would almost forgotten the purpose of my exertions.
6819,0.0,all i knew was getting to king's cross.
6820,0.35,but now my progress was blocked.
6821,0.0,trafalgar square was packed tight for speeches.
6822,-0.09999999999999998,we approached on an explosion of applause and shouting.
6823,-1.1,"the litter under my feet, thin streamers of fine plastic, tangled with the wheels."
6824,0.15000000000000002,i risked being trampled by going down below knee level to pull the mess clear.
6825,0.0,"it was going to take me a long time to reach the charing cross road, 200 yards away."
6826,0.0,no one wanted or was able to give way.
6827,0.8500000000000001,it was no easier to retreat than to advance.
6828,0.0,all the side streets were filling now.
6829,-0.5,"the din, the clatter, the foghorns, bass drums, whistles and chants were both thunderous and piercing."
6830,-2.0,"as i fought to edge his lordship forward, i penetrated--but so slowly--layers of disappointment and anger, confusion and blame."
6831,-1.85,"poverty, unemployment, housing, healthcare and care for the old, education, crime, race, gender, climate, opportunity--every old problem of social existence remained unsolved, according to all the voices, placards, t-shirts and banners."
6832,-0.75,who could doubt them?
6833,1.3,it was a great clamour for something better.
6834,-2.95,"and pushing my dirty broken chair, its complaining wheel lost to the din, i squeezed through the crowd unnoticed, with a new problem about to be added to the rest--wondrous machines like adam and his kind, whose moment had not quite yet come."
6835,0.5,making progress up st. martin's lane was just as hard.
6836,0.0,"further north, the crowds began to thin."
6837,0.8500000000000001,"but just as i reached new oxford street, the noisy wheel locked and for the rest of the way i had to lift and tilt the chair as well as push."
6838,-0.4,i stopped at a pub near the british museum and drank a pint of shandy.
6839,0.0,"from there, i phoned miranda again."
6840,0.0,still no news.
6841,-0.25,i arrived three hours late for my appointment at york way.
6842,-0.25,a security guard behind a long curving slab of marble made a call and asked me to sign myself in.
6843,0.0,"after ten minutes, two assistants came and took adam away."
6844,0.25,one of them returned half an hour later to take me up to meet the director.
6845,0.0,the lab was a long room on the seventh floor.
6846,-0.25,under a glare of strip lighting were two stainless-steel tables.
6847,0.5,"on one of them was adam, no longer a lord, on his back, still in his best clothes, with a power cable trailing from his midriff."
6848,0.95,"on the other table was a head, gleaming black and muscular, standing upright on its truncated neck."
6849,0.0,another adam.
6850,0.85,"the nose, i noticed, with its broad and complex surfaces, was kinder, friendlier than our adam's."
6851,0.6,"the eyes were open, the gaze was watchful."
6852,0.9,"my father would have known for sure, but i thought there was a strong resemblance, or at least a reference, to the young charlie parker."
6853,0.85,"he had a studied look, as though he was counting himself in on some complex musical phrase."
6854,0.75,i wondered why my purchase had not also been modelled after a genius.
6855,0.0,there were a couple of open laptops by adam.
6856,0.6,"i was going forward to look at them when a voice behind me said, ""i here's nothing as yet."
6857,0.0,"you really did for him."""
6858,0.0,"i turned, and as i shook turing's hand, he said, ""was it a hammer?"""
6859,0.65,he led me down a long corridor to a cramped corner office where there was a good view to the west and south.
6860,0.0,"here we stayed, drinking coffee for almost two hours."
6861,0.4,there was no small talk.
6862,-0.75,"naturally, the first question was what had brought me to this act of destruction."
6863,0.7500000000000001,"to answer, i told him everything i had omitted before, all that had happened since, ending with adam's symmetrical notion of justice and its threat to the adoption process as the because of ""the deed."""
6864,-0.75,"as before, turing took notes, and interrupted occasionally for clarification."
6865,-0.4,he wanted details of the hammer blow.
6866,0.0,how close was i?
6867,0.0,what sort of hammer?
6868,0.0,how heavy?
6869,-0.6,did i use full force and both hands?
6870,0.30000000000000004,"i spoke of adam's dying request, which i was now fulfilling."
6871,0.0,"about the suicides and the recall of all the adams and eves, i said i was sure that he, turing, knew a lot more than i did."
6872,-0.5,"from far away, in the direction of the demonstration, came the rattle of a snare drum and the thrilling notes of a hunting horn."
6873,-0.25,the thick cloud cover was partly breaking up in the west and glints of the setting sun
6874,0.25,touched turing's office.
6875,0.0,he continued writing after i had finished
6876,-0.25,and i was able to watch him unobserved.
6877,0.0,"he wore a grey suit and pale green silk shirt without a tie, and on his feet brogues of matching green."
6878,0.6,the sun caught one side of his face as he made his notes.
6879,0.25,"he looked very fine, i thought."
6880,0.0,at last he was done and clipped his pen inside his jacket and closed the notebook.
6881,1.0,he regarded me thoughtfully--
6882,0.0,"i could not hold his gaze--then he looked away, pursing his lips and tapping the desk with a forefinger."
6883,1.15,i have no privileged information on the suicides.
6884,-0.5,only my suspicions.
6885,-1.85,"i think the a-and-es were illequipped to understand human decision-making, the way our principles are warped in the force field of our emotions, our peculiar biases, our self-delusion and all the other well-charted defects of our cognition."
6886,-0.75,soon these adams and eves were in despair.
6887,2.0,"they could not understand us, because we could not understand ourselves."
6888,0.8,their learning programs could not accommodate us.
6889,1.15,"if we did not know our own minds, how could we design theirs and expect them to be happy alongside us?"
6890,0.0,"but that is just my hypothesis."""
6891,0.5,he fell silent for a short while and seemed to make a decision.
6892,-0.75,"thirty years ago, in the early fifties, i got into trouble with the law for having a homosexual relationship."
6893,0.0,you might have heard about it.
6894,-0.75,i was contemptuous.
6895,-0.75,"this was a consenting matter, it caused no harm and"
6896,1.0,"i knew there was plenty of it about at every level, including that of my accusers."
6897,-0.75,"but of course it was also devastating, for me and especially for my mother."
6898,-1.0,social disgrace.
6899,-2.0,i was an object of public disgust.
6900,-2.25,"i would broken the law and therefore i was a criminal and, as the authorities had considered for a long while, a security risk."
6901,-0.25,"from my war work, obviously, i knew a lot of secrets."
6902,-1.75,"it was that old recursive nonsense--the state makes a crime of what you do, what you are, then disowns you for being vulnerable to blackmail."
6903,-2.5,"the conventional view was that homosexuality was a revolting crime, a perversion of all that was good and a threat to the social order."
6904,-0.85,"but in certain enlightened, scientifically objective circles, it was a sickness and the sufferer should not be blamed."
6905,2.0,"fortunately, a cure was on hand."
6906,-1.05,"it was explained to me that if i pleaded or was found guilty, i could choose to be treated rather than punished."
6907,-0.25,begular injections of oestrogen.
6908,0.0,"chemical castration, so-called."
6909,-0.5,"i knew i was not ill, but i decided to go for it."
6910,-0.75,not simply to stay out of prison.
6911,0.4,i was curious.
6912,0.0,i could rise above the whole business by regarding it as an experiment.
6913,0.75,what could a complex compound like a hormone do to a body and a mind?
6914,0.0,i would make my own observations.
6915,0.75,"hard now, looking back, to feel the attraction of what i thought then."
6916,0.0,in those days i had a highly mechanistic view of what a person was.
6917,1.75,"the body was a machine, an extraordinary one, and the mind i thought of mostly in terms of intelligence, which was best modelled by reference to chess or maths."
6918,0.65,"simplistic, but it was what i could work with."""
6919,0.25,"once again, i was flattered that he should confide in me such intimate details, some of which i already knew."
6920,-1.0,but i was also uneasy.
6921,-0.35,i suspected that he was leading me somewhere.
6922,0.0,his sharp gaze made me feel stupid.
6923,-1.0,"in his voice, i thought i heard the faint remnants of that impatient, clipped tone familiar from wartime broadcasts."
6924,-1.7999999999999998,i belonged to a spoiled generation who had never known the threat of imminent invasion.
6925,-0.5,"this was frivolous, they said."
6926,-0.25,not enough is known about the effects.
6927,-0.75,you could get cancer.
6928,-0.4,your body will change radically.
6929,0.8,you might grow breasts.
6930,-1.0,you could become severely depressed.
6931,0.0,"i listened, resisted, but in the end, i came round."
6932,-2.65,"i pleaded guilty to avoid a trial, and refused the treatment."
6933,1.0,"in retrospect, though it did not seem like it at the time, it was one of the best decisions i ever made."
6934,0.0,"for all but two months of my year in wandsworth, i had a cell to myself."
6935,0.4,"being cut off from experimental work, wet-bench stuff and all the usual obligations"
6936,-1.75,"because of the war, quantum mechanics was moribund from neglect."
6937,0.4,there were some curious contradictions that i wanted to explore.
6938,0.75,i was interested in paul dirac's work.
6939,1.4,"above all, i wanted to understand what quantum mechanics could teach computer science."
6940,-0.6,"few interruptions, of course."

6945,-0.09999999999999998,"and they left me alone, f was free!"
6946,0.0,i did my best year's work since we broke the enigma code in '41.
6947,0.0,or since the computer logic papers i wrote in the mid-thirties.
6948,-0.5,"i even made some headway with the p versus np problem, though it was not formulated in those terms for another lifteen years."
6949,0.75,i was excited by crick and watson's paper on the structure of dna.
6950,1.4500000000000002,"i began to work on the first sketches that led eventually to winner-take-all dna neural networks--the sort of thing that helped make adam and eve possible."""
6951,-1.5,"it was while turing was telling me about his first year after wandsworth, how he cut loose from the national physical laboratory and the universities and set up on his own, that i felt my phone vibrating in my trouser pocket."
6952,0.0,an incoming text.
6953,0.0,"miranda, with the news."
6954,0.0,i longed to see it.
6955,-0.75,but i had to ignore it.
6956,0.6,"turing was saying, ""we had money from some friends in the states and from a couple of people here."
6957,1.0,we were a brilliant team.
6958,0.0,old bletchley.
6959,0.5,the best.
6960,0.0,our first job was to make ourselves financially independent.
6961,0.65,we designed a business computer to calculate weekly wages for big companies.
6962,0.65,it took us four years to pay back our generous friends.
6963,0.5,"i hen we settled down to serious artificial intelligence, and this is the point of my story."
6964,0.0,"at the start, we thought we were within ten years of replicating the human brain."
6965,0.050000000000000044,"but every tiny problem we solved, a million others would pop up."
6966,-0.5,"have you any idea what it takes to catch a ball, or raise a cup to your lips, or make immediate sense of a word, a phrase or an ambiguous sentence?"
6967,0.0,"we did not, not at first."
6968,0.8,solving maths problems is the tiniest fraction of what human intelligence does.
6969,1.8,we learned from a new angle just how wondrous
6970,0.0,a thing the brain is.
6971,0.0,"a onelitre, liquid-cooled, three-dimensional computer."
6972,-2.2,"unbelievable processing power, unbelievably compressed, unbelievable energy efficiency, no overheating."
