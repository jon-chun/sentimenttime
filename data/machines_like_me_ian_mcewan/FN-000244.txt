The carriage was almost empty when I got on the Tube
at Clapham North. Once we were north of the river, the train
began to fill with people, mostly young, carrying placards and
furled banners. Yet another unemployment march was com-
ing to an end. At first they looked like a typical rock-and-roll
crowd. The humid air carried a scent of cannabis, like a fond
memory of a long day. But there was another constituency, a
large minority, some of whom carried plastic Union Jacks on
sticks—that foolish stock-market position of mine—or wore
Union Jack t-shirts. These factions loathed each other but were
making common cause. A fragile alliance had been formed,
with dissenters on both sides resisting any affiliation at all. The
right blamed unemployment on immigration from Europe
and the Commonwealth. British workers' wages were being
undercut. Foreign arrivals, dark-skinned and white, were add-
ing to the housing crisis; doctors' waiting rooms and hospital
wards were overcrowded and so were local schools, whose play-
grounds were supposedly filling with eight-year-old girls in
headscarves. Whole neighbourhoods had been transformed in
a generation, and no one in faraway Whitehall had ever asked
the locals.
The left heard nothing but xenophobic and racist dis-
tortion in these complaints. Their grievance list was longer:
stock-market greed, underinvestment, short-termism, the
worship of shareholder value, unreformed company law, the
ravages of an unrestrained free market. I went on one march,
then gave up after I read about a new car factory starting pro-
duction outside Newcastle. It built three times as many cars
as the factory it replaced—with one-sixth of the work force.
