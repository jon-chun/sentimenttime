Ma chines Like Me

hours. I knew everything now: the day of her mother's death,
which she remembered clearly, her father, whose kindness and
distance combined to inflame her love for him, and always
Mariam. In the months after her death, Miranda had gone to
a mosque in Winchester—she didn't dare meet the family at
prayer in Salisbury. After she resumed the visits in London,
her lack of belief began to get in the way. She felt fraudulent
and stopped going.
We talked parents, as serious young lovers do, to explain
who we were and why, and what we cherished and what we
were in flight from. My mother, Jenny Friend, community
nurse for a large semi-rural area, had seemed during my
childhood in a state of constant exhaustion. Later I understood
that my father's absences and affairs wore her down more than
her job. They never liked each other much, though they didn't
fight in my presence. But they were terse. Mealtimes were sub-
dued, sometimes taken in rigid silence. Conversations tended
to be routed through me. My mother might say to me in the
kitchen, "Go and ask your father if he's out tonight." He was
well known on the circuit. At his peak, the Matt Friend Quar-
tet played at Ronnie Scott's and recorded two albums. His kind
of mainstream jazz had its largest audience from the mid-
fifties to the early sixties. Then the young, the cool, turned
away as pop and rock swept in. Bebop was squeezed into a
niche, somewhat churchy, the preserve of frowning men with
long, querulous memories. My father's income shrank and his
infidelities and drinking increased.
When she heard all this, Miranda said, "They didn't love
each other. But did they love you?"
