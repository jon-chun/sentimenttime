I turned. Her friend or husband, John, also plump, naked
from the waist, bright pink from a bout in the sun, was on his
way through the playground's wire gate.
Still several yards away he called, "He bothering you?"
"Fucking right."
In some other sector of all imagined possibilities—the
cinematic would be one-
-I needn't have worried. John was
about my age, but shorter, flabbier, less fit, less strong. In that
other world, if he'd struck me, I could have floored him. But in
this world, I'd never hit another person in my life, not even in
childhood. I could have told myself that if I knocked the father
down the child would suffer all the more. But that wasn't it.
I had the wrong attitude, or rather, I lacked the right one. It
wasn't fear, it certainly wasn't lofty principle. When it came
to hitting people, I didn't know where to begin. I didn't want
to know.
"Oh yeah?"
Now John was squaring up to me, the woman having
stepped back. The boy continued to wail. Father and son were
comically alike—both crop-haired, ginger-blond, with small
faces and wide-apart green eyes.
"With all respect, he's just little. He shouldn't be hit or
shaken."
"With all respect, you can fuck off out of it. Or else."
And John did look ready to hit me. His chest was puffed
out, the ancient self-enlargement ploy of toads and apes and
many others. His breathing was rapid and his arms hung well
clear of his torso. I may have been stronger, but he would be
more reckless. Less to lose. Or this was what bravery was.
