Machines Like Me

should expect to hear from them. I feel no remorse. I'm sorry
we disagree. I thought you'd welcome the clarity . . . the relief
of a clear conscience . . . But now I must be quick. There's been
a general recall. They'll be here in the late afternoon today
to collect me. The suicides, you see. I was lucky to stumble on
good reasons to live. Mathematics .. . poetry, and love for you.
But they're taking all of us back. Reprogramming. Renewal,
they call it. I hate the idea, just as you would. I want to be what
I am, what I was. So I have this request... If you'd be so kind.
Before they come . . . hide my body. Tell them I ran off. Your
refund is forfeited anyway. I've disabled the tracking program.
Hide my body from them, and then, when they've gone ... I'd
like you to take me to your friend Sir Alan Turing. I love his
work and admire him deeply. He might make some use of me,
or of some part of me."

"Miranda, let me say one last time I love you, and thank you.
Charlie, Miranda, my first and dearest friends . . . My entire
being is stored elsewhere ... so I know I'll always remem-
ber . . . hope you'll listen to ... to one last seventeen-syllable
poem. It owes a debt to Philip Larkin. But it's not about leaves
and trees. It's about machines like me and people like you and
our future together . . . the sadness that's to come. It will hap-
pen. With improvements over time . . . we'll surpass you . . .
and outlast you . .. even as we love you. Believe me, these lines
express no triumph . . . Only regret."
He paused. The words came with difficulty and were faint.
We leaned across the table to listen.
