The young woman's hand hovered near her mother's elbow to
steady her. I glanced at Adam again and saw an expression,
hard to identify at first—astonishment was my first thought.
He was transfixed as the two came nearer.
The young woman saw Adam and stopped. They were
staring hard at each other. The woman with the cane was irri-
tated at being held up and plucked at her daughter's sleeve.
Adam made a sound, a smothered gasp. When I looked again
at the couple, I understood. The younger one was pale and
pretty in an unusual way, a clever variation on a theme. The
woman with the cane hadn't grasped what was happening.
She wanted to get on her way and gave an irritable command
to her young companion. In her, there was no mistaking the
line of that nose, or the blue eyes flecked with tiny black rods.
Not a daughter at all, but Eve, Adam's sister, one of thirteen.
I thought it was my responsibility to make some kind of
contact with her. The couple were no more than twenty feet
away. I raised a hand and called out ridiculously, "I say . . ."
and started to go towards them. They might not have heard;
my words could have been lost to Benn's speech. I felt Adam's
hand on my shoulder.
He said softly, "Please don't."
I looked again at Eve. She was a beautiful unhappy girl.
The face was pale, with an expression of pleading and misery
as she continued to stare at her twin.
"Go on," I whispered. "Talk to her."
The woman lifted her cane and pointed in the direction
she intended to go. At the same time, she dragged at Eve's arm.
I said, "Adam. For God's sake. Go on!"
