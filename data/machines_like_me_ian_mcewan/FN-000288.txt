He wouldn't move. With her gaze still locked on him, Eve
allowed herself to be led away. They moved off through the
crowd. Just before they disappeared from view, she turned for
one last look. She was too far away for me to read her expres-
sion. She was no more than a small pale face bobbing in the
press of bodies. Then she was gone. We could have followed
them but Adam had already turned in the other direction and
had gone to stand by the oak tree.
We set off for home in silence. I should have done more to
encourage him to approach his twin. We stood side by side on
the crowded Tube heading south. I was haunted, and I knew
he was too, by Eve's abject look. I decided not to press him to
explain why he had turned away. He would tell me when he
was ready. I should have spoken to her, I kept thinking, but he
didn't want it. The way he had stood with his back to her, gaz-
ing into the tree trunk as she vanished into the crowd! I'd been
neglecting him. I'd been lost to a love affair. In the daily round,
it no longer amazed me that I could pass the time of day with
a manufactured human, or that it could wash the dishes and
converse like anyone else. I sometimes wearied of his earnest
pursuit of ideas and facts, of his hunger for propositions that
lay beyond my reach. Technological marvels like Adam, like
the first steam engine, become commonplace. Likewise, the
biological marvels we grow up among and don't fully under-
stand, like the brain of any creature, or the humble stinging
nettle, whose photosynthesis had only just been described on a
quantum scale. There is nothing so amazing that we can't get
used to it. As Adam blossomed and made me rich, I had ceased
to think about him.
