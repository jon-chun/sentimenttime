Camden, I was seeing Adam in different terms. I watched him
closely for signs of existential misery. As Turing's lone horse-
man, he roamed the digital landscapes at night. He must have

watched and waited and made his calculations. He dealt in
minute currency fluctuations, mere tremors in the exchange
rate, and advanced his gains by minuscule amounts. From the
