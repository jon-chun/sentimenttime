Machines Like Me

stared ahead, immobile, and remained that way for a long
time. On his lap was a brown envelope. I decided not to go out
and ask his views on the assassination.
In the early afternoon, after Miranda had said her good-
byes to Mark and finished another conversation with Jasmin,
she came down to find me. I was at the screen in pointless pur-
suit of more news, angles, opinions, statements. It turned out
she had known as soon as the story broke. She leaned against
the door frame, I remained in my seat. Physical proximity
would have seemed like disrespect. Our conversation was
much like my thoughts, a circular chase around an incompre-
hensible event—the cruelty of it, the stupidity. People with
Irish accents had been attacked in the streets. The crowd
outside Parliament had grown so large it was being moved
by the police to Trafalgar Square. Mrs. Thatcher's office had
released a statement. Was it sincere? We decided it was. Did
she write it herself? We couldn't be sure. "Though we dis-
agreed on many fundamentals of policy, I knew him to be
a thoroughly kind, decent, honest man of huge intelligence
who always wanted the best for his country." Whenever our
conversation strayed into likely consequences, we felt we were
betraying the moment and accepting a world without him. We
weren't ready, and we turned back, although Miranda did say
that with Healey we would keep our "end-time" bombs after
all. I was hardly a Tory, but I thought I would have been just
as shocked if Mrs. Thatcher had been in that hotel bed. What
horrified me was the ease with which the edifice of public,
political life could be shaken apart. Miranda saw it differently.
