interrupted by bright nodules, tiny vividly striped cylinders—
capacitors, resistors—then an induction coil I have wound
myself, then an op-amp. I understand nothing. I follow a wir-
ing diagram as a novice might murmur scripture. Mr. Cox
gives softly spoken advice. I clumsily solder one piece, one wire
or component, to another. The smoke and smell of solder is a
drug I inhale deeply. 1 include in my circuit a toggle switch
made of Bakelite which, I've persuaded myself, came out of
a fighter plane, a Spitfire surely. The final connection, three
months after my beginning, is from this piece of dark brown
plastic to a nine-volt battery.
It's a cold, windy dusk in March. Other boys are hunched
over their projects. We are twelve miles away from Shake-
speare's hometown, in what will come to be known as a "bog-
standard" comprehensive school. An excellent place, in fact.
The fluorescent ceiling lights come on. Mr. Cox is on the far
side of the lab with his back turned. I don't want to attract his
attention in case of failure. I throw the switch and—miracle—
hear the sound of static. 1 jiggle the variable-tuning capacitor:
music, terrible music, as I think, because violins are involved.
Then comes the rapid voice of a woman, not speaking English.
No one looks up, no one is interested. Building a radio is
nothing special. But I'm speechless, close to tears. No technol-

name or understand her language, and never meet her, not
knowingly. My radio, with its irregular blobs of solder on a
