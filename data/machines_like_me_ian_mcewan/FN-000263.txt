time when we must lose. She was right, probability demanded
it, and I had no answer. I took £800 out of the account and gave
her half. Adam pushed on with his work.
There are people who see the word "equation" and their
thoughts rear up like angry geese. That's not quite me, but
I sympathise. I owed it to Turing's hospitality to attempt to
understand his solution to the P versus NP problem. I didn't
even understand the question. I tried his original paper, but it
lay well beyond me—too many different forms of bracket, and
symbols that encapsulated histories of other proofs or entire
systems of mathematics. There was an intriguing "iff"—not
a misspelling. It meant "if and only if." I read the responses
to the solution, made to the press in layman's terms by fel-
low mathematicians. "A revolutionary genius," "breathtaking
shortcuts," "a feat of orthogonal deduction" and, best of all, by
a winner of the Fields Medal, "He leaves many doors behind
him that are barely ajar and his colleagues must do their best
to squeeze through one and try to follow him through the
next."
I turned back and tried to understand the problem.
I learned that P stood for polynomial time and N stood for
non-deterministic. That took me nowhere. My first mean-
ingful discovery was that if the equation was shown not to
be true, that would be extremely helpful, for then everyone
could stop thinking about it. But if there was a positive proof,
that P really did equate to NP, it would have, in the words of
the mathematician Stephen Cook, who formulated the prob-
lem in these terms in 1971, "potentially stunning practical
