as rapist may have calculated that he had nothing to lose. A
wild fiction and he almost got away with it. If he was innocent,
if the texts existed, then the system had let him down. Either
way, it had let itself down. His story should have been checked.
On that, I was with the sceptical press. The blame could lie
with an inexperienced legal aid team, too hard-pressed, too
sloppy. Or with policemen greedy for success. And certainly
with an ill-tempered judge.
On my way back from the Common, 1 slowed as I turned
into my road. Now I knew as much as Adam. I hadn't spoken to
him since the evening before. After a painful, sleepless night,
I had got up early to go to the hospital. As I went through
the kitchen I had passed close by him. He was sitting at the
kitchen table as usual, connected to his power line. His eyes
were open and had that tranquil, faraway look whenever he
retreated into his circuits. I had hesitated there for a whole
minute, wondering what I had got into with my purchase. He
was far more complicated than I'd imagined, and so were my
own feelings about him. We had to confront each other, but I
was exhausted from two broken nights and needed to get to
the hospital.
What I wanted now, returning from my walk, was to
retreat to my bedroom for a dose of painkillers and a nap. But
he was standing facing me as I came in. At the sight of my
arm suspended in its sling, he gave a cry of astonishment or
horror. He came towards me, arms spread.
"Charlie! I am so sorry. So sorry. What a terrible thing I
did. I honestly didn't intend it. Will you please, please accept
my most sincere apologies."
