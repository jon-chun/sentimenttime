Machines Like Me

It was my mind's eyes, or my heart's, that watched as
Adam and Miranda lay down on the unyielding embrace of
the futon and found the comfortable posture for a clasp of
limbs. I watched as she whispered in his ear, but I didn't hear
the words. She had never whispered in my ear at such times.
I saw him kiss her—longer and deeper than I had ever kissed
her. The arms that heaved up the window frame were tightly
around her. Minutes later I almost looked away as he knelt
with reverence to pleasure her with his tongue. This was the
celebrated tongue, wet and breathily warm, adept at uvulars
and labials, that gave his speech its authenticity. I watched,
surprised by nothing. He didn't fully satisfy my beloved then,
as I would have, but left her arching her slender back, eager
for him as he arranged himself above her with smooth, slow-
loris formality, at which point my humiliation was complete.
I saw it all in the dark—men would be obsolete. I wanted to
persuade myself that Adam felt nothing and could only imi-
tate the motions of abandonment. That he could never know
what we knew. But Alan Turing himself had often said and
written in his youth that the moment we couldn't tell the dif-
ference in behaviour between machine and person was when
we must confer humanity on the machine. So when the night
air was suddenly penetrated by Miranda's extended ecstatic
scream that tapered to a moan and then a stifled sob—all this
I actually heard twenty minutes after the shattering of the
window—I duly laid on Adam the privilege and obligations of
a conspecific. I hated him.
