meeting took a month to arrange. Peter Gorringe, relaxed
and cheerful, charmed the police sergeant. It was a joke, he
had said, this talk of killing. Merely a manner of speaking, as
in—this was in the policeman's notes—"I'd kill for a chicken
madras." He may have said something in front of his cellmate,
a none-too-bright fellow, now released. This fellow must have
been passing through Salisbury and thought he'd deliver the
message. He was always a little bit vindictive. The policeman
wrote all this down, delivered a caution, and the two men,
finding common ground in their lifelong support for Man-
chester City, parted after a handshake.
I listened as best I could. Anxiety is a great diluter of
attention. Adam listened too, nodding sagely, as if he'd not
been powered down this past hour and understood every-
thing already. Miranda's mood-tone, to which I was so closely
attuned, was lightly tinged with indignation, now directed at
the authorities rather than me. Not believing anything Gor-
ringe had told the detective sergeant, she'd been to the weekly
surgery of our Clapham MP—Labour, of course, a tough old
bird, union organiser, scourge of the bankers. She directed
Miranda back to the police. Her prospective murder was not a
constituency matter.
After this account, a silence. I was preoccupied by the
obvious question my own deceit prevented me from asking.
What had she done to deserve a death?
Adam said, "Does Gorringe know this address?"
"He can easily find out."
"Have you ever seen or heard of him being violent?"
