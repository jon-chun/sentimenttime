Elgin Crescent with Mark. We would live together there as
a family. Wonderful. Assuming the process of fostering and
adoption could be completed within nine months, a good local
primary school in Ladbroke Grove had a place for "our son"—I
struggled with the phrase, but I remained outwardly pleased.
She told me that the adoption people had been unhappy with
her living arrangements. A one-bedroom flat was not suffi-
cient. Here was the plan: we should remove the outer doors to
our flats and make the hall our shared space. We could deco-
rate and carpet it. We needn't trouble the landlord. When it
was time to move to the new place, we would put everything
back. We would convert her kitchen into a bedroom for Mark.
No need for disruptive plumbing. We would cover the cooker,
sink and work surfaces with boards that we could drape with
colourful fabrics. The kitchen table could be folded away and
stored in her—"our"—bedroom. Our lives would be one, and
of course I liked all this, it was exciting. I joined in.
It was almost midnight when we went to the table to eat
the meal she had prepared. From next door came the rattle of
Adam at the keyboard. He wasn't making us richer on the cur-
rency markets. He was typing up the transcript of Gorringe's
confession, including his self-identification. The transcripts
and the video and accompanying narrative would make up a
single file that would go to a named senior officer at a police
station in Salisbury. A copy would also go to the Director of
Public Prosecutions.
"I'm a coward," Miranda said. "I'm dreading the trial. I'm
frightened."
I went to the fridge for the bottle and refilled our glasses.
