I sat, like candidates for a job. At any other time I would have
stood to embrace her, offered to make her coffee. She was a
morning addict and liked it strong. Instead, I cocked my head,
met her gaze and waited. Of course, she was dressed for tennis,
the ball was in her—ah, how I hated my own stupid thoughts.
I couldn't imagine any good coming from a conversation with
these two. Far better to contemplate Barney's luck with his
new heart.
She said to Adam, "Why don't you . . ." She indicated
his usual chair, and drew it back for him. He sat promptly.

plugged himself in. Of course he would be much depleted.
She reached across his shoulder for the place on his nape and
pressed. It was clearly by agreement. As soon as his eyes closed,
his head slumped, and we were alone.
