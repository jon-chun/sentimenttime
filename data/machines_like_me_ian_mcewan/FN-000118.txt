Machines Like Me

Being ready to take a chance on not getting felled and your
head lifted and slammed down on the tarmac many times,
with lifelong neural consequences. A chance I wouldn't take.

you. For the little boy's benefit."
Then John said something so surprising that I was com-

"Do you want him?"
"What?"
"You can have him. Go on. You're an expert on kids. He's
yours. Take him home with you."
The child had gone quiet by this point. Looking at him
again, I thought he had something his father lacked, though
perhaps not his mother—a faint but still luminous signal in
his expression of intelligent engagement, despite his distress.

we heard, above the traffic, the distant shouts of children by

On an impulse, I called the father's bluff. "All right," I
said. "He can come and live with me. We'll sort out the paper-

I took a card from my wallet and gave it to him. Then I
put my hand out to the boy and to my surprise he raised his
and slotted his fingers between mine. I felt flattered. "What's
his name?"
"Mark."
"Come on, Mark."
