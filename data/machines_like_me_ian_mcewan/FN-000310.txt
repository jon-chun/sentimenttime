Machines Like Me

Then she said, "I still have to tell myself, really remind
myself, that she's never coming back. And I'm beginning to
realise . . She hesitated. ". . . that I'll never get over it. And I
never want to."
Again, silence. I was waiting to say my piece. She was
looking straight ahead, not at me. Her eyes were clear, without

in bed, sometimes through the night. The sex is wonderful and

the closest. .. It's what I used to feel with Mariam."
Here was my cue, the right moment, the only location. "I
came out to find you."
"Yes?"
I hesitated, suddenly unsure of the best order of words. "To
ask you to marry me."

had no reason to be. She said, "Charlie, yes. Yes, please. But
I have something to confess. You might want to change your
mind."
The light in the garden was fading. Some blackness was
coming down. I'd assumed I was a poor substitute for Mariam,
but a sincere one. I remembered what Adam told me on the
Common. Her own crimes. If she was about to say that she'd
been having sex with him, despite her promises, then we were
finished. It couldn't, it mustn't be that. But what else, what
other crime could she own up to?
I said, "I'm listening."
"I've been lying to you."
