I said, "It must have occurred to you last night, lying
under a plastic robot, screaming your head off, that it's the
human factor you hate."
She said, "You just told me he's human."
"But you think he's a dildo. Nothing too complicated.
That's what turns you on."
She knew a knight's move too. "You fancy yourself as a
lover."
I waited.
"You're a narcissist. You think making a woman come is
an achievement. Your achievement."
"With you it is." That was nonsense.
She was standing now. "I've seen you in the bathroom.
Adoring yourself in the mirror."
An excusable error. My days sometimes began with an
unspoken soliloquy. A matter of seconds, usually after shav-
ing. I dried my face, looked myself in the eye, listed failings,
the usual: money, living quarters, no serious work and, lately,
Miranda—lack of progress, now this. I also set myself tasks for
the day ahead, trivial stuff, embarrassing to relate. Take out
the rubbish. Drink less. Get a haircut. Get out of commodities.
I never thought I'd been observed. A bathroom door, hers or
mine, could have been ajar. Perhaps my lips were moving.
But this was not the time to set Miranda straight. Across
from us sat comatose Adam. Glancing at him now, at the mus-
cular forearms, the steep angle of his nose, and feeling a prick
of resentment, I remembered. As I said the words, I knew I
could be making an important mistake.
"Remind me what the Salisbury judge said."
