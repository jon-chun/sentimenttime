appointments, we arrived at a new stage. We went beyond
devising symbolic representations of all likely circumstances
and inputting thousands of rules. We were approaching the
gateway of intelligence as we understand it. The software
now searched for patterns and drew inferences of its own. An
important test came when our computer played a master at the
game of go. In preparation, the software played against itself
for months—it played and learned, and on the day—well, you
know the story. Within a short while, we had stripped down
our input to merely encoding the rules of the game and task-
ing the computer to win. At this point we passed through that
gateway with so-called recurrent networks, from which there
were spin-offs, especially in speech recognition. In the lab we
went back to chess. The computer was freed from having to
understand the game as humans played it. The long history of
brilliant manoeuvres by the great masters was now irrelevant
to the programming. Here are the rules, we said. Just win in
your own sweet way. Immediately the game was redefined
and moved into areas beyond human comprehension. The
machine made baffling mid-game moves, perverse sacrifices,
or it eccentrically exiled its queen to a remote corner. The pur-
pose might become clear only in a devastating endgame. All
this after a few hours' rehearsal. Between breakfast and lunch
the computer quietly outclassed centuries of human chess.
Exhilarating. For the first few days, after we realised what
it had achieved without us, Demis and I couldn't stop laugh-
ing. Excitement, amazement. We were impatient to present
our results.
"So. There's more than one kind of intelligence. We'd
