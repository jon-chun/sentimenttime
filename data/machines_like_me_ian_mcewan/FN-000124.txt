Machines Like Me

was so ferocious and localised that his other complaints had
faded.
I was still holding her hand. I said, "You know how much
I want to meet him. Let me come with you next time.''
Several seconds passed before she drowsily replied, "I'd
like to go very soon."
"Good."
Then, after another pause, "Adam must come too."
She stroked my forearm in a gesture of farewell as she
turned on her side, away from me. Soon her breathing was
regular and deep, and I was left pondering in the monochrome
sodium dusk. He's coming too. She had assumed joint owner-
ship, just as I'd hoped. But an encounter between Adam and
an old-style literary curmudgeon like Maxfield Blacke was
hard to envisage. I knew from the profile that he still worked
in longhand, detested computers, mobile phones, the Internet
and all the rest. Apparently he didn't, in that priggish cliche,
"suffer fools gladly." Or robots. Adam had yet to be woken. He
had yet to leave the house, yet to test his luck as a plausible
being capable of small talk. I'd already decided to keep him
away from my circle of friends until he was a fully adept social
creature. Starting out with Maxfield could disable important
sub-routines. Miranda might have been hoping to distract her
father and energise his writing. Or it was to do with me, some-
how in my interests in ways I didn't understand. Or—I failed
to resist this thought—against them?
That was a bad idea, of the kind that comes in the small
hours. Like all insomniac brooding, the essence was repeti-
tion. Why should I meet her father in the presence of Adam?
