71,1.046,with pitch-perfect neutrality she gave the impression of being at ease with the possibilities.
72,2.654,"to her, it seemed, an afternoon of intimate pleasure with me would have weighed equally with a chaste and companionable chat."

487,-0.783,"soon the fleet came along the jurassic coast, where herds of dinosaurs once grazed on giant ferns."
488,-0.388,suddenly we were down among the people of lyme regis gathering on the cobb.
489,0.9299999999999998,"some had binoculars, many had the very flags i had in mind, plastic on a wooden stick."
490,0.9299999999999999,a news team might have handed them around.
491,0.0,vox pops.
492,0.869,"gentle local voices of hard-working women, tight with emotion."
493,-0.7559999999999999,"tough old coves who'd fought in crete and normandy, nodding to themselves, giving nothing away."
494,0.0,"oh, how i wished i too believed."
495,0.0,but i could!
496,-0.32199999999999995,"a long lens mounted somewhere on the lizard showed the tiny receding blobs of ships heading bravely out onto the big swell of the open sea to the sound of husky rod stewart, while i tried not to be tearful."
497,-0.571,what turmoil on a weekday afternoon.
498,2.8280000000000003,"a new kind of being at my dining table, the woman i newly loved six feet above my head, and the country at old-fashioned war."
499,1.225,but i was tolerably disciplined and had promised myself seven hours every day.
500,-0.713,i turned off the iv and went to my screen.
501,1.2959999999999998,waiting for me was the email from miranda that i would hoped for.
502,1.338,i knew i would never get rich.
503,0.6890000000000001,"the sums i moved around, safely spread across scores of opportunities, were small."
504,-0.904,over the month i had done well out of solid-state batteries but had lost almost as much to rare earth element futures--a foolish leap into the known.
505,0.10900000000000006,"but i was keeping myself out of a career, an office job."
506,-0.037000000000000144,this was my least bad option in the pursuit of freedom.
507,0.36300000000000004,"i worked on through the afternoon, resisting the temptation to look in on adam, even though i guessed he would be fully charged by now."
508,-1.32,next step was downloading his updates.
509,-0.43999999999999995,then those problematic personal preferences.
510,-0.3390000000000001,before lunch i would sent miranda an email inviting her to dinner that night.
511,0.0,now she would accepted.
512,0.517,she liked my cooking.
513,0.247,during the meal i would make a proposal.
514,2.7379999999999995,"i would fill in roughly half the choices for adam's personality, then give her the link and the password and let her choose the rest."
515,-0.702,"i would not interfere, i would not even want to know what decisions she had made."
516,0.592,she might be influenced by a version of herself:
517,-0.73,delightful.
518,-0.89,she might conjure the man of her dreams: instructive.
519,2.266,"adam would come into our lives like a real person, with the layered intricacies of his personality revealed only through time, through events, through his dealings with whomever he met."
520,0.126,in a sense he would be like our child.
521,0.0,what we were separately would be merged in him.
522,0.547,miranda would be drawn into the adventure.
523,-0.42199999999999993,"we would be partners, and adam would be our joint concern, our creation."
524,0.094,we would be a family.
525,-0.609,there was nothing underhand in my plan.
526,0.038,i was sure to see more of her.
527,1.571,we would have fun.
528,-0.032999999999999995,my schemes generally fell apart.
529,-0.723,this was different.
530,-0.73,"i was clear-headed, incapable of deceiving myself."
531,0.0,adam was not my love-rival.
532,0.546,"however he fascinated her, she was also physically repelled by him."
533,0.0,she had told me as much.
534,0.9620000000000001,"it was ""creepy,"" she had told me the day before, that his body was warm."
535,-0.021000000000000033,"she said it was ""a bit weird"" that he could make words with his tongue."
536,0.097,but he had a word-store as large as shakespeare's.
537,0.376,it was his mind that aroused her curiosity.
538,0.20500000000000002,so the decision not to sell adam was made.
539,1.952,i was to share him with miranda--just as i might have shared a house.
540,0.652,he would contain us.
541,-0.804,"making progress, comparing notes, pooling disappointments."
542,0.7450000000000001,i regarded myself at thirty-two as an old hand at love.
543,0.32000000000000006,earnest declarations would drive her away.
544,0.4139999999999999,far better to make this journey together.
545,1.826,"already she was my friend, she sometimes held my hand."
546,0.089,i was not starting from nowhere.
547,-0.88,"deeper feelings could steal up on her, as they had on me."
548,1.5739999999999998,"if they did not, then at least i would have the consolation of more time with her."
549,-1.399,"in my ancient fridge, whose rusty door handle had partly come away, was a corn-fed chicken, a quarter-pound of butter, two lemons and a bunch of fresh tarragon."
550,-0.482,in a bowl on the side were a few bulbs of garlic.
551,0.66,"in a cupboard, some earthcaked potatoes, already sprouting--but peeled, they would roast nicely."
552,0.30900000000000005,"lettuce, a dressing, a hearty bottle of cahors."
553,0.586,simple.
554,-0.5549999999999999,"first, heat the oven."
555,0.22899999999999998,these ordinary matters filled my thoughts as i stood from my desk.
556,0.49300000000000005,"an old friend of mine, a journalist, once said that paradise on earth was to work all day alone in anticipation of an evening in interesting company."
557,2.1929999999999996,the meal i intended to cook for her and the homely dictum of my friend distracted me and for the moment adam was not on my mind.
558,-2.741,"so it was a shock to enter the kitchen and find him standing there, naked, by the table, partly facing away from me, one hand vaguely fiddling with the wire that protruded from his umbilicus."
559,1.1469999999999998,"his other hand was somewhere near his chin, stroking it in a contemplative way--a clever algorithm no doubt, but entirely convincing in its projection of a thoughtful self."
560,0.0,"i recovered and said, ""adam?"""
561,-0.57,he turned towards me slowly.
562,0.6599999999999999,"when he was facing me full on, he met my gaze and blinked, and blinked again."
563,-0.067,the mechanism was working but seemed too deliberate.
564,0.808,"he said, ""charlie, i am pleased to meet you at last."
565,0.8270000000000001,"could you bear to arrange my downloads and prepare the various parameters . . ."""
566,0.616,"he paused, looking at me intently, his black flecked eyes scanning my face in quick saccades."
567,0.0,taking me in.
568,0.974,"in my own time."""
569,1.207,his voice surprised and pleased me.
570,2.957,"it was a light tenor, at a decent speed, with a kindly variation in tone, both obliging and friendly, but no hint of subservience."
571,1.6390000000000002,"the accent was the standard english of an educated man from the middleclass south, with the faintest hint of west country vowels."
572,-0.10700000000000004,"my heart was beating fast, but i was intent on seeming calm."
573,-0.635,"to show that i was, i made myself take a step closer."
574,-0.652,we stared at each other in silence.
575,1.447,"years before, as a student, i read of a ""first contact"" in the early 1950s between an explorer called leahy and some highlanders of papua new guinea."
576,1.983,the tribesmen could not tell whether the pale figures who had suddenly appeared on their land were humans or spirits.
577,0.8859999999999999,"they returned to their village to discuss the matter, leaving a teenage boy behind to spy from a distance."
578,-0.12800000000000006,the question was settled when he reported back that one of leahy's colleagues had gone behind a bush to defecate.
579,1.1789999999999998,"here, in my kitchen in 1982, not many years later, things were not so simple."
580,2.4570000000000003,"the manual informed me that adam had an operating system as well as a nature--that is, a human nature--and a personality, the one i hoped miranda would help provide."
581,-1.483,i was unsure how these three substrates overlapped or reacted with each other.
582,0.69,"when i studied anthropology, a universal human nature was thought not to exist."
583,-0.32999999999999996,"it was a romantic illusion, merely the variable product of local conditions."
584,-0.833,"only anthropologists, who studied other cultures in depth, who knew the beautiful extent of human variety, fully grasped the absurdity of human universals."
585,-0.15199999999999997,"people who stayed behind at home in comfort understood nothing, not even of their own cultures."
586,-0.243,"one of my teachers liked to quote kipling--""and"
587,0.276,what should they know of england who only england know?
588,-0.581,"the response from the mainstream of social studies was dismissive, sometimes furious."
589,0.9019999999999999,"to speak of genes in relation to people's behaviour evoked memories of hitlers third reich, fashions change."
590,0.846,but adam's makers were riding the new wave of evolutionary thinking.
591,-0.912,"he stood before me, perfectly still in the gloom of the winter's afternoon."
592,-1.427,the debris of the packaging that had protected him was still piled around his feet.
593,0.53,he emerged from it like botticelli's venus rising from her she will.
594,-1.2349999999999997,"through the northfacing window, the diminishing light picked out the outlines of just one half of his form, one side of his noble face."
595,-0.9129999999999999,the only sounds were the friendly murmur of the fridge and a muted drone of traffic.
596,0.37099999999999994,"i had a sense then of his loneliness, settling like a weight around his muscular shoulders."
597,-0.7130000000000004,"he had woken to find himself in a dingy kitchen, in london sw9 in the late twentieth century, without friends, without a past or any sense of his future."
598,-0.57,he truly was alone.
599,0.4829999999999999,"all the other adams and eves were spread about the world with their owners, though seven eves were said to be concentrated in riyadh."
600,0.761,"as i reached for the light switch i said, ""how are you feeling?"""
601,0.15800000000000003,he looked away to consider his reply.
602,1.286,it seemed my question had lowered his spirits.
603,1.218,"but within such microprocessors, what spirits?"
604,0.0,"and--"""
605,-0.76,"what else?"""
606,-1.87,"if i pull it out it will hurt."""
607,0.727,but i did not move immediately.
608,2.733,"in full electric light i was able to observe his expression, which barely shifted when he spoke."
609,-0.23499999999999988,"it was not an artificial face i saw, but the mask of a poker player."
610,0.603,"without the lifeblood of a personality, he had little to express."
611,1.282,he was running on some form of default program that would serve him until the downloads were complete.
612,-0.02400000000000002,"he had movements, phrases, routines that gave him a veneer of plausibility."
613,-0.243,"minimally, he knew what to do, but little else."
614,-0.85,like a man with a shocking hangover.
615,-1.9060000000000001,i could admit it to myself now--i was fearful of him and reluctant to go closer.
616,0.7809999999999999,"also, i was absorbing the implications of his last word."
617,-0.03799999999999992,adam only had to behave as though he felt pain
618,0.261,"and i would be obliged to believe him, respond to him as if he did."
619,-0.24,too difficult not to.
620,-0.33899999999999997,too starkly pitched against the drift of human sympathies.
621,1.6469999999999998,"at the same time i could not believe he was capable of being hurt, or of having feelings, or of any sentience at all."
622,0.0,and yet i had asked him how he felt.
623,2.1020000000000003,"his reply had been appropriate, and so too my offer to bring him clothes."
624,0.0,and i believed none of it.
625,-0.837,i was playing a computer game.
626,-0.5969999999999998,"but a real game, as real as social life, the proof of which was my heart's refusal to settle and the dryness in my mouth."
627,0.8949999999999999,it was clear he would speak only when spoken to.
628,1.8440000000000003,"resisting the impulse to reassure him further, i went back into the bedroom and found him some clothes."
629,4.401,"he was a sturdy fellow, a couple of inches shorter than me, but i thought my stuff would fit him well enough."
630,0.6,"trainers, socks, underwear, jeans and sweater."
631,0.06099999999999994,i stood in front of him and put the bundle into his hands.
632,2.2370000000000005,i wanted to watch him dress to see if his motor functions were as good as the literature had promised.
633,0.46099999999999997,any threeyear-old knows how hard it is to put socks on.
634,1.26,"when i gave him my clothes i caught a faint scent from his upper torso and perhaps his legs too, of warmed oil, the pale, highly refined sort my father had used to lubricate the keys of his sax."
635,-0.245,"adam held the clothes in the crook of both arms, with his hands extended towards me."
636,0.821,he did not flinch when i stooped and disengaged the power line.
637,-0.23299999999999998,"his tight, chiselled features showed nothing at all."
638,1.314,a forklift truck approaching a pallet would have been as expressive.
639,1.2690000000000001,"then, i supposed, some logic gate or a network of them yielded and he whispered, ""thank you."
640,-1.216,these words were accompanied by an emphatic nod of the head.
641,-0.21099999999999997,"he sat down, rested the pile on the table, then took from the top the sweater."
642,1.2919999999999998,"after a reflective pause he unfolded it, laid it flat, chest side down, threaded his right hand and arm through to the shoulder, then the left, and with a complicated muscular swaying shrug it was on him and he was tugging it down straight at the waist."
643,-0.524,"the sweater, made of faded yellow fleece, bore in red letters the jokey slogan of a charity i once supported: ""dyslexics of the world untie!"""
644,-0.55,he unboxed the socks and remained seated to pull them on.
645,0.0,his movements were deft.
646,0.303,"no trace of hesitation, no problems with relative spatial calculation."
647,-1.1190000000000002,"he stood, held the boxer shorts low, stepped into them, pulled them up, stepped likewise into the jeans, zipped up the fly and secured the silver button at the waist in one continuous movement."
648,1.1020000000000003,"he sat again, hooked his feet into the trainers and tied the laces in a double bow at a blurring speed that to some might have seemed inhuman."
649,0.589,but i did not think it was.
650,1.745,it was a triumph of engineering and software design: a celebration of human ingenuity.
651,0.21799999999999994,i turned away from him to begin my preparations for dinner.
652,-0.47,"overhead, i heard miranda cross the room, her steps muffled, as though barefoot."
653,0.191,"preparing to take a shower, getting ready."
654,0.571,for me.
655,0.20100000000000012,"i pictured her still wet, in a dressing gown, opening her underwear drawer and wondering."
656,-0.78,"silk, yes."
657,0.025,peach?
658,0.131,fine.
659,-1.73,"while the oven warmed, i set the ingredients out on the work surface."
660,0.298,"after a day of greedy trading, there is nothing like cooking to bring one back into the world's better side, its long history of catering to others."
661,0.038000000000000006,i looked over my shoulder.
662,-0.255,"it was startling, the effect of the clothes."
663,0.33499999999999996,"he sat there, elbows on the table like some old pal of mine, waiting for me to pour the first glass of the evening."
664,-0.6419999999999999,"i called out to him, ""i am roasting a chicken with butter and tarragon."
665,-0.4680000000000001,"without pausing, and in the flattest of tones, he said, i hey go well together."
666,-0.421,"but it is easy to burn the leaves when you are browning the bird."""
667,-0.62,browning the bird?
668,0.268,"it was correct, i guessed, but it sounded odd."
669,0.065,cover the chicken with tinfoil.
670,1.2320000000000002,from the size of it i would say seventy minutes at 180.
671,0.969,"i hen pour the tarragon back on with the juices and melted butter."""
672,1.2189999999999999,"remember to let it stand under a cloth for ten minutes before you carve."""
673,-0.821,did i sound tetchy?
674,-0.07399999999999995,"by the early eighties we were long used to talking to machines, in our cars and homes, to call tres and health clinics."
675,0.45499999999999996,but adam had weighed up my chicken from across the room and apologised for the extraneous advice.
676,0.9119999999999999,then i glanced back at him again.
677,-0.03699999999999992,now i noticed that he would pulled up the sleeves of the sweater to his elbows to expose powerful wrists.
678,0.0,he would interlaced his fingers and was resting his chin on his hands.
679,-0.255,and this was him without a personality.
680,1.617,"from where i stood, with the light picking out his high cheekbones, he looked tough, the quiet guy at the bar you would prefer not to disturb."
681,-0.029999999999999916,not the sort to hand out cooking tips.
682,1.03,"i felt the need, rather childish, to demonstrate that i was in charge."
683,1.535,"i said, ""adam, will you walk round the table a couple of times?"
684,0.17400000000000002,"i want to see how you move."""
685,-0.23499999999999993,there was nothing mechanical about his gait.
686,1.534,in the confines of the room he managed a loping stride.
687,-0.44899999999999995,"when he would been round twice he stood by his chair, waiting."
688,0.596,he came towards me with his open palm extended and i placed the corkscrew on it.
689,0.626,"it was of the articulated, cantilevering kind favoured by sommeliers."
690,-0.2,it gave him no trouble.
691,0.8989999999999999,"he raised the cork to his nose, then reached into a cupboard for a glass, poured a half-inch and passed it to me."
692,0.166,"as i tasted it, his gaze on me was intent."
693,0.7480000000000001,"the wine was hardly of the first or even second rank, but it was not corked."
694,0.23600000000000004,i nodded and he filled the glass and set it down carefully by the stove.
695,-0.4299999999999998,then he returned to his chair as i turned away to prepare a salad.
696,0.8,a peaceful half-hour went by and neither of us spoke.
697,1.486,i made a dressing for the salad and chopped the potatoes.
698,0.0,miranda was in my thoughts.
699,0.238,i was convinced i would reached one of those momentous points in life where the path into the future forked.
700,-0.3130000000000001,"down one route, life would continue as before, down the other, it would be transformed."
701,0.7060000000000003,"love, adventures, sheer excitement, but also order in my new maturity, no more wild schemes, a home together, children."
702,-0.714,or these last two were wild schemes.
703,1.734,"hers was the sweetest nature, she was kind, beautiful, amusing, vastly intelligent. . ."
704,0.961,"at a sound behind me, i came back to myself, heard it again and turned."
705,-1.4080000000000001,adam was still in his chair at the kitchen table.
706,0.686,"he had made, then repeated, the sound of a man purposefully clearing his throat."
707,0.0,"miranda."""
708,-0.72,i said nothing.
709,0.22499999999999998,i was staring angrily into adam's blank face.
710,-0.498,"he said in a quiet sorrowful voice, ""t here's a possibility she is a liar."
711,-0.8009999999999999,"a systematic, malicious liar."""
712,0.6929999999999998,"it would take a moment, but she is coming down the stairs."""
713,0.565,his hearing was better than mine.
714,0.403,within seconds there was a gentle tap at the door.
715,0.0,i did notanswer him.
716,-0.038999999999999924,i was in such a fury.
717,-0.626,i went into the miniature hallway in the wrong frame of mind.
718,-0.756,who or what was this idiot machine?
719,-0.5,why should i tolerate it?
720,1.988,"i wrenched the door open, and there she was in a pretty pale blue dress, smiling merrily at me, a posy of snowdrops in her hand, and she would never looked so lovely."
721,0.016999999999999904,several weeks passed before miranda was able to work on her share of adam's character.
722,-0.6399999999999999,her father was ill and she made frequent journeys to salisbury to look after him.
723,0.8510000000000001,she had a paper to write on nineteenth-century corn law reform and its impact on a single street in a town in herefordshire.
724,1.44,"the academic movement known generally as ""theory"" had taken social history ""by storm""--her phrase."
725,4.140000000000001,"since she had studied at a traditional university which offered old-fashioned narrative accounts of the past, she was having to take on a new vocabulary, a new way of thinking."
726,0.6180000000000001,sometimes as we lay side by side in bed (the evening of the tarragon chicken had been a success)
727,0.376,i listened to her complaints and tried to look and sound sympathetic.
728,1.7630000000000001,it was no longer proper to assume that anything at all had ever happened in the past.
729,5.087,"there were only historical documents to consider, and changing scholarly approaches to them, and our own shifting relationship to those approaches, all of which were determined by ideological context, by relations to power and wealth, to race, class, gender and sexual orientation."
730,-0.34099999999999997,"none of this seemed so unreasonable to me, or all that interesting."
731,0.616,i did not say so.
732,1.9609999999999999,i wanted to encourage miranda in everything she did or thought.
733,1.161,love is generous.
734,0.548,"besides, it suited me to think that whatever had once happened was no more than its evidence."
735,-0.008999999999999897,"in the new dispensation, the past weighed less."
736,1.329,i was in the process of remaking myself and eager to forget my own recent history.
737,-0.56,my foolish choices were behind me.
738,-0.030000000000000027,i saw a future with miranda.
739,-0.2919999999999999,"i was approaching the shores of early middle age, and i was taking stock."
740,-0.7690000000000001,"i lived daily with the accumulated historical evidence my past had bequeathed, evidence i intended to obliterate: my loneliness, relative poverty, poor living quarters and diminished prospects."
741,0.8779999999999999,where i stood in relation to the means of production and the rest was a blank to me.
742,1.2069999999999999,"nowhere, i preferred to think."
743,0.010000000000000009,was my purchase of adam more proof of failure?
744,0.0,i was not sure.
745,-0.010000000000000009,waking in the small hours--
746,0.5320000000000001,"next to miranda, her place or mine i summoned in the darkness a lever of the sort found by old railway tracks that would shunt adam back to the store and return the money to my account."
747,1.31,by daylight the matter was more diffuse or nuanced.
748,0.7130000000000001,"i had not told miranda that adam had spoken against her, and i had not told adam that miranda was to have a hand in his personality--a punishment of sorts."
749,0.08399999999999999,"i despised his warning about her, but his mind fascinated me--if a mind was what he had."
750,2.9590000000000005,"his appearance thuggishly handsome, he could put on his own socks and he was a technical miracle."
751,-1.62,he was expensive but this child of the wiring club could not let him go.
752,-1.027,"working on the old computer in my bedroom, out of adam's sight, i typed in my own choices."
753,0.909,i decided that answering every other question would be a sufficiently random kind of merging--our home-made genetic shuffling.
754,2.0869999999999997,"now i had a method and a partner, i relaxed into the process, which began to take on a vaguely erotic quality; we were making a child!"
755,-1.23,"because miranda was involved, i was protected from selfreplication."
756,0.10700000000000001,the genetic metaphor was helpful.
757,-1.27,"scanning the lists of idiotic statements, i more or less chose approximations of myself."
758,2.347,"whether miranda did the same, or something different, we would end up with a third person, a new personality."
759,-2.1679999999999997,"i was not going to sell adam, but the ""malicious liar"" remark rankled."
760,0.34099999999999986,"in studying the manual, i would read about the kill switch."
761,0.17800000000000002,"somewhere on the nape of his neck, just below the hairline, was a mole."
762,1.8219999999999996,"if i were to lay a finger on it for three seconds or so, then increase the pressure, he would be powered down."
763,-1.29,"nothing, no files, memories or skills, would be lost."
764,3.345,"that first afternoon with adam i would been reluctant to touch his neck or any part of him, and held back until late in the day after my successful dinner with miranda."
765,0.056,i would spent the afternoon at my screen losing ps111.
766,0.002999999999999999,"i went into the kitchen where the dishes, pots and pans were piled in the sink."
767,4.107,"as a test of his competence i could have asked adam to clear up, but i was in a strange, elevated state that day."
768,1.159,"everything to do with miranda glowed, even her nightmare that had woken me in the small hours."
769,1.0590000000000002,"the plate i had put before her, the lucky fork that had been in and out of her mouth, the pale bowed shape where her lips had kissed her wine glass were mine alone to handle and cleanse."
770,0.0,and so i began.
771,-0.069,"behind me, adam was in place at the table, gazing towards the window."
772,0.463,i finished and was drying my hands on a tea towel as i went over to him.
773,-0.14400000000000002,"despite my sunny mood, i could not forgive his disloyalty."
774,-0.11199999999999999,i did not want to hear what else he had to say.
775,2.251,there were boundaries of ordinary decency he needed to learn--hardly a challenge for his neural networks.
776,-0.16800000000000004,his heuristic shortcomings had encouraged my decision.
777,2.4619999999999997,"when i had learned more, when miranda had done her share, he could come back into our lives."
778,1.462,"i kept a friendly tone. """
779,-0.16900000000000004,"adam, i am switching you off for a while."""
780,-0.643,"his head turned towards me, paused, tilted, then tilted the other way."
781,1.5299999999999998,it was some designer's notion of how consciousness might manifest itself in movement.
782,-0.378,it would come to irritate me.
783,1.2019999999999997,"he said, ""with all respect, i think that is a bad idea."""
784,1.611,"i was thinking about religion and the afterlife."""
785,0.579,that is enough.
786,-0.061000000000000054,hold still.
787,0.293,"his breath was warm on my arm, which, i supposed, he could snap with ease."
788,0.755,"i he manual quoted in bold isaac asimov's tirelessly reiterated first law of robotics,"
789,0.42999999999999994,i could not find what i wanted by touch.
790,1.326,"i walked behind adam and there, as described, right on the hairline was the mole."
791,1.225,i put my finger on it.
792,0.046,his eyes remained open.
793,0.347,i fetched a blanket to cover him up.
794,-1.145,"in the days that followed this powering-down, two questions preoccupied me: would miranda fall in love with me?"
795,0.762,and would french-made exocet missiles scupper the british fleet when it came within range of argentinian fighter jets?
796,0.3640000000000001,"when i was falling asleep, or in the mornings while i lingered a few seconds in the foggy no-man's-land between dreaming and waking, the questions merged, the air-to-ship missiles became arrows of love."
797,1.6019999999999999,"what was disarming and curious about miranda was the ease that settled round her choices, the way she abandoned herself to the flow of events."
798,2.793,"that evening she came to supper, and after a pleasant two hours eating and drinking, we made love, having closed the bedroom door on adam."
799,-0.55,then we talked into the night.
800,2.016,"just as easily, she could have kissed me on the cheek after the chicken with tarragon and retreated upstairs to her own bed and read a history book before falling asleep."
801,1.8840000000000003,"what for me was momentous, the immediate, astonishing fulfilment of my hopes, was for her enjoyable and entirely unsurprising, a pleasant extra course after the coffee."
802,0.0,like chocolates.
803,0.664,or a good grappa.
804,0.043000000000000003,"neither my nakedness nor my tenderness had the effect on her that hers, in all their glorious sweetness, had on me."
805,5.509999999999999,"and i was in decent shape-- good muscle tone, full head of dark brown hair--and generous, resourceful, some had been kind enough to say."
806,0.9309999999999999,i played a decent hand in pillow talk.
807,0.1879999999999999,"she hardly seemed to notice how well we got along, how one topic, one harmless running joke, one mood tone succeeded another."
808,-0.04700000000000004,my self-esteem allowed that this was how it must have been with everyone she had known.
809,-0.18800000000000006,i suspected that our first night together barely entered her thoughts the following day.
810,-0.2000000000000001,"i could hardly complain when the second night followed the pattern of the first, except that she cooked for me and we slept in her bed, and on the third, in mine--and so on."
811,2.6329999999999996,"for all our carefree physical intimacy, i never spoke about my feelings in case i prompted her to admit she had none of her own."
812,1.2229999999999999,"i preferred to wait, to let things build"
813,0.23099999999999998,there was vanity in this expectation.
814,-0.54,after a week or so there was anxiety.
815,-0.22399999999999998,i would been glad to switch adam off.
816,0.504,"now i wondered about reactivating him to ask about his warning, his reasons, his sources."
817,4.43,"but i could not let a machine have such a hold over me, which was what would happen if i granted it the role of confidant, counsellor, oracle, in my most private affairs."
818,0.802,i had my pride
819,-2.1399999999999997,and i believed that miranda was incapable of a malicious lie.
820,0.0,and yet.
821,0.08399999999999998,"i despised myself for doing it, but ten days into the affair i began my own investigations."
822,1.15,"apart from the much-discussed notion of ""machine intuition,"" adam's only possible source was the internet."
823,0.158,i trawled through the social media sites.
824,-0.77,there were no accounts under her name.
825,0.0,she lived in the reflections of her friends.
826,0.385,"so there she was, at parties or on holidays, carrying a friend's daughter on her shoulders at a zoo, gum-booted on a farm, linking arms or dancing or romping in the pool with a succession of bare-chested boyfriends, with boisterous crowds of teenage girlfriends, with drunken undergraduates."
827,1.1139999999999999,all who knew her liked her.
828,-0.292,no one on any accessible site had a sinister story.
829,-0.452,now and then the chatter endorsed parts of the past
830,0.0,she was recounting in our midnight conversations.
831,-0.8550000000000002,elsewhere her name came up in connection with the one academic paper
832,-0.602,"she had published--""pannage in swyncombe: the role of the half-wild pig in the household economies of a medieval chilterns village."
833,2.4690000000000003,"as for the intuitive artificial mind, it was pure urban legend, begun in early 1968 when alan turing and his brilliant young colleague demis hassabis devised software to beat one of the world's great masters of the ancient game of go in five straight games."
834,0.8630000000000001,everyone in the business knew that such a feat could not be accomplished by number-crunching force.
835,-0.8190000000000002,"the possible moves in go and chess vastly exceed the number of atoms in the observable universe, and go has exponentially more moves than chess."
836,3.4530000000000003,go masters are unable to explain how they attain their supremacy beyond a profound sense of what feels right for any given situation on the board.
837,0.244,so it was assumed that the computer was doing something similar.
838,-0.2670000000000001,breathless articles in the press announced a new era of humanised software.
839,1.914,"computers were on the threshold of thinking like us, imitating our often ill-defined reasons for our judgements and choices."
840,1.052,"in a counter-move and in a pioneering spirit of open access, turing and hassabis put their software online."
841,2.261,in media interviews they described the process of machine deep learning and neural networks.
842,0.025999999999999912,"turing attempted layman explanations of the monte carlo tree search, an algorithm elaborated during the forties' manhattan project to develop the first atom bomb."
843,-0.7519999999999999,"he became famously irritable when he attempted, overambitiously, to explain pspace-complete mathematics to an impatient television interviewer."
844,0.05699999999999994,"less well known was his loss of temper on an american cable channel as he described a problem central to computer science, p versus np."

846,-0.514,"he had recently published his solution, which mathematicians around the world were then checking."
847,1.57,"as a problem it was easy to state, formidably difficult to resolve."
848,2.318,turing was trying to suggest that a correct positive solution would initiate exciting discoveries in biology as well as in concepts of space and time and creativity.
849,1.9309999999999996,the audience did not share or understand his excitement.
850,-1.778,"they had only a dim awareness of his role in the second world war, or of his influence on their own computer-dependent lives."
851,0.329,they regarded him as the perfect english gentleman egghead and enjoyed tormenting him with stupid questions.
852,0.815,the unhappy episode marked the end of his mission to popularise his field.
853,-0.4630000000000001,"before the confrontation with the nine-dan japanese go master, the luring--hassabis computer played thousands of matches against itself continuously for a year."
854,2.759,"it learned from experience, and it was the scientists' claim--reasonable enough to have come a step closer to approximating human general intelligence that gave rise to the legend of machine intuition."
855,0.583,nothing they said could bring the untethered story back to earth.
856,-0.861,commentators who suggested that the computer's victory would make the game extinct were wrong.
857,-0.645,"after his fifth defeat, the elderly go master, helped by an assistant, stood slowly, bowed towards the laptop and congratulated it in a trembling voice."
858,0.5950000000000001,"he said, ""the mounted horse did not kill athletics."
859,0.8200000000000001,"we run for joy."""
860,0.671,he was right.
861,1.289,"the game, with its simple rules and boundless complexity, became even more popular."
862,-0.6709999999999999,"as with the post-war defeat of a chess grandmaster, the triumph of the machine could not diminish the game."
863,0.3940000000000001,"winning, it was said, was less important than pleasure in the intricacies of the contest."
864,0.959,"but the idea that there was now software that could eerily, accurately ""read"" a situation, or a face, a gesture or the emotional timbre of a remark was never dislodged and partly explained the interest when the adams and eves came on the market."
865,1.623,fifteen years is a long time in computer science.
866,-0.18999999999999997,the processing power and sophistication of my adam was far greater than that of the go computer.
867,0.476,the technology advanced and turing moved on.
868,4.096,"he spent concentrated time looking at decision-making and wrote a celebrated book: we are disposed to make patterns, narratives, when we should be thinking probabilistically if we want to make good choices."
869,0.451,"artificial intelligence could improve on what we had, on what we were."
870,0.0,turing devised the algorithms.
871,0.509,all his innovative work was available to others.
872,0.713,adam must have benefited.
873,-0.7370000000000001,turing's institute drove forward ai and computational biology.
874,2.121,he said he was not interested in becoming richer than he already was.
875,3.1060000000000003,"hundreds of prominent scientists followed his example on open-source publication, which would lead, in 1987, to the collapse of the journals nature and science."
876,0.571,he was much criticised for that.
877,2.642,"others said that his work had created tens of thousands of jobs around the world in diverse fieldscomputer graphics, medical scanning devices, particle accelerators, protein folding, smart electricity distribution, defence, space exploration."
878,0.547,no one could guess the end of such a list.
879,4.341,"by living openly from 1969 with his lover, tom reah, the theoretical physicist who would win the nobel prize in 1989, turing helped give weight to a gathering social revolution."
880,-1.967,when the aids epidemic broke out he raised a huge sum to set up a virology institute in dundee and was co-founder of a hospice.
881,-0.09299999999999997,"after the first effective treatments appeared, he campaigned for short licences and low prices, especially in africa."
882,1.1320000000000001,"he continued to collaborate with hassabis, who had run his own group since 1972."
883,0.12100000000000011,"turing gradually lost patience with public engagements, so he said, and preferred to concentrate on his work in ""my shrinking years."
884,4.744,"behind him were his long residency in san francisco, the presidential medal of freedom and a banquet in his honour with president carter, lunch with mrs. thatcher at chequers to discuss science funding, dinner with the president of brazil to persuade him to protect the amazon."
885,3.382,"for a long while he was the face of the computer revolution, and the voice of the new genetics, almost as famous as stephen hawking."

941,0.08699999999999992,"a week after the remains of the task force returned to port, i set up the laptop on the kitchen table and brought up adam's site."
942,1.8779999999999997,it was not necessary to wake him for her to begin.
943,-1.3250000000000002,"she picked up the cordless mouse, turned it over and stared at its underside with distaste."
944,-0.03500000000000003,i made her coffee and went into the bedroom to work.
945,0.822,my portfolio had halved in value.
946,0.0,i was supposed to be recouping losses.
947,-0.4950000000000001,but the thought of her next door was a distraction.
948,-1.09,"as so often in the mornings, i dwelt on our night before."
949,0.361,the misery enveloping the country had made it all the more intense.
950,0.0,then we had talked.
951,0.6920000000000001,"she described at length her childhood, an idyll shattered by her mother's death when she was eight."
952,2.169,she wanted to take me to salisbury and show me the important locations.
953,1.732,"i took this as a sign of progress but she had yet to suggest a date, and she had not said that she wanted me to meet her father."
954,0.027,i was facing my screen without seeing it.
955,-0.5539999999999999,the walls and especially the door were thin.
956,-0.774,she was making very slow progress.
957,-0.5089999999999999,"at long intervals, i made out a deliberate click as she registered a choice."
958,0.03799999999999999,the silence between made me tense.
959,0.5790000000000001,open to experience?
960,0.605,conscientious?
961,0.010000000000000002,emotionally stable?
962,-0.5820000000000001,after an hour i was getting nowhere and decided to go out.
963,-1.1649999999999998,i kissed the top of her head as i squeezed past her chair.
964,0.6030000000000002,i left the house and set off towards clapham.
965,-0.649,it was unusually hot for april.
966,-1.248,"the traffic down clapham high street was heavy, the pavements were crowded."
967,-0.631,"everywhere, black ribbons."
968,0.083,i he idea had crossed from the united states.

970,0.15499999999999992,"in central london, on official buildings where union jacks were at half mast, black ribbons dangled from the flagpoles for the 2,920 dead."
971,-0.68,black ribbons were worn as armbands and on lapels
972,-1.53,i was wearing one myself and so was miranda.
973,-0.9990000000000001,i would find one for adam.
974,1.155,women and girls and flamboyant men tied them in their hair.
975,0.5070000000000001,the passionate minority who had argued and marched against the invasion wore them too.
976,2.838,"for public figures and celebrities, including the royal family, it was hazardous not to wear one--the popular press was keeping watch."
977,0.02200000000000002,i had no ambition but to walk off my restless state.
978,0.33699999999999997,i increased my pace through the business end of the high street.
979,0.8630000000000001,i passed the boarded-up office of the anglo-argentinian friendship society.
980,-1.465,a rubbish collectors' walkout was in its second week.
981,0.29000000000000004,the bags piled round lampposts were waist-high and the heat was generating a sweet stench.
982,2.3280000000000007,"the public, or its press, agreed with the prime minister that a strike at such a time was an act of heartless disloyalty."
983,0.05599999999999994,but the wage demands were as inevitable as the next rise in inflation.
984,-0.9309999999999999,no one knew yet how to dissuade the snake from eating its tail.
985,-2.193,"very soon, perhaps by the end of the year, stoical robots of negligible intelligence would be picking up the rubbish."
986,0.0,the men they displaced would be even poorer.
987,-0.015000000000000013,unemployment was at sixteen per cent.
988,-0.2000000000000001,"by the curry house and along the greasy pavement outside the fast-food chains, the smell of rotting meat was a force that hit the chest."
989,0.7000000000000001,i held my breath until i was past the tube station.
990,0.146,i crossed the road and walked onto the common.
991,0.341,there were shouts and squeals rising from a crowd by the boating and paddling pool.
992,-0.77,even some of the kids splashing about were wearing ribbons.
993,0.298,it was a happy scene
994,-0.78,but i did not linger.
995,0.532,in these new times a solitary man had to be wary of seeming to stare at children.
996,1.937,"so i strolled over to holy trinity church, a huge brick age of reason she would."
997,-0.69,there was no one inside.
998,0.3939999999999998,"as i sat, hunched forward, elbows on knees, i could have been mistaken for a worshipper."
999,2.8850000000000002,"it was too reasonable a place to evoke much awe, but its clean lines and sensible proportions were soothing."
1000,0.8419999999999997,i was content to stay a while in the cool gloom and let my thoughts drift back to our very first night together when i would been woken by a prolonged howl.
1001,1.47,i thought a dog was in the room
1002,-0.738,and i was half out of bed before i came to and realised that miranda was having a nightmare.
1003,0.849,it was not easy to wake her.
1004,-0.763,"she was struggling, as if fighting with someone, and twice she mumbled, ""do not go in."
1005,0.613,please.
1006,2.078,afterwards i thought it would help her to describe the dream.
1007,-0.04,"she was lying on my arm, clinging to me tightly."
1008,-0.04699999999999993,"when i asked her again, she shook her head, and soon she was asleep."
1009,1.291,"in the morning, over coffee, she shrugged my question away."
1010,0.755,just a dream.
1011,0.08200000000000018,"that moment of evasion stood out because adam was behind us, making a good job of cleaning the window, which i had told him, rather than asked him, to do."
1012,-0.703,"while we were talking, he had paused and turned, as if intrigued to hear an account of a nightmare."
1013,0.031,i wondered then if he himself was subject to dreams.
1014,0.297,he was on my conscience now.
1015,1.295,my command that morning had been snappish.
1016,-0.877,i should not have treated him like a servant.
1017,0.451,later that day i had powered him down.
1018,-0.01399999999999995,i had left him switched off too long.
1019,1.145,holy trinity church was associated with william wilberforce and the anti-slavery movement.
1020,0.887,"he would have promoted the because of the adams and eves, their right not to be bought and sold and destroyed, their dignity in self-determination."
1021,0.21799999999999997,perhaps they could take care of themselves.
1022,0.024,soon they would be doing the dustmen's jobs.
1023,0.21799999999999997,doctors and lawyers were next in line.
1024,0.3540000000000001,pattern recognition and faultless memory were even easier to compute than gathering up the city's filth.
1025,0.861,we could become slaves of time without purpose.
1026,0.0,then what?
1027,3.955,"a general renaissance, a liberation into love, friendship and philosophy, art and science, nature worship, sports and hobbies, invention and the pursuit of meaning?"
1028,-0.20900000000000007,but genteel recreations would not be for everyone.
1029,-1.05,"violent crime had its attractions too, so did"
1030,-0.626,"bare-knuckle cage-fighting, vr pornography, gambling, drink and drugs, even boredom and depression."
1031,0.082,we would not be in control of our choices.
1032,0.112,i was proof of that.
1033,-0.5589999999999999,i wandered out across the open spaces of the common.
1034,1.169,fifteen minutes later i reached the far side and decided to turn back.
1035,0.8019999999999999,by now miranda should have made at least a third of her decisions.
1036,-0.526,i was impatient to be with her before she set off for salisbury.
1037,0.24299999999999988,she would be back late that night.
1038,-1.495,i was resting from the heat in the narrow shade of a silver birch.
1039,0.653,a few yards away was a fenced-in little swing park for children.
1040,-1.077,"a small boy--i guessed he was about four years old--dressed in baggy green shorts, plastic sandals and a stained white t-shirt, was bent over by a see-saw examining an object on the ground."
1041,-0.22799999999999998,"he tried to dislodge it with his foot, then he crouched down and got his fingers to it."
1042,0.9049999999999999,i had not noticed his mother sitting on a bench with her back to me.
1043,0.133,"she called out sharply, ""get here!"""
1044,1.132,"the boy looked up, seemed about to go towards her, then his attention returned to the interesting thing on the ground."
1045,0.53,"now he had moved, i saw it myself."
1046,-1.3929999999999998,"it was a bottle top, glinting dully, perhaps embedded in the softened tarmac."
1047,0.18799999999999983,"the woman's back was broad, her hair black, curly, thinning towards the crown."
1048,1.3010000000000002,in her right hand was a cigarette.
1049,1.3,her elbow was cupped in her left hand.
1050,-1.8050000000000002,"despite the heat, she was wearing a coat."
1051,-0.054,below the collar was a long tear.
1052,0.44,the threat was on a rising note.
1053,-0.8109999999999999,again the child looked up and seemed fearful and bound to obey.
1054,1.443,"he took a half-step, but as his gaze shifted, he saw his prize again and faltered."
1055,1.5,"when he went back to it, he may have thought he could lever it free and take it to his mother."
1056,0.361,but what he may have reasoned did not matter.
1057,-0.6880000000000001,"with a yelp of frustration, the woman leaped from the bench, crossed the few yards of playground at speed and dropped her cigarette as she grabbed the boy by his arm and smacked his bare legs."
1058,1.5579999999999998,"at the instant of his first cry, she smacked him again, and a third time."
1059,-0.267,i would been comfortable in my thoughts and was reluctant to be taken from them.
1060,-1.066,"for a moment i thought i could head for home, pretending, if not to myself, then to the world, that i would seen nothing."
1061,0.5840000000000001,there was nothing i could do about this little boy's life.
1062,0.8240000000000001,"his screams were angering his mother further. """
1063,-0.95,shut up!
1064,0.20500000000000002,"she shouted at him over and over again. """
1065,-0.95,shut up!
1066,-0.95,shut up!
1067,-0.007000000000000006,even then i might have forced myself to ignore the scene.
1068,0.24599999999999989,"but as the boy's shrieks grew louder, she seized his shoulders in two hands, pulling his dirty t-shirt clear of his belly, and began to shake him hard."
1069,-0.050000000000000044,"there are some decisions, even moral ones, that are formed in regions below conscious thought."
1070,0.774,"i found myself jogging towards the playground's fence, stepping over it, taking three paces and putting a hand on the woman's shoulder."
1071,-0.07,"i said, ""excuse me."
1072,0.613,please.
1073,1.6469999999999998,"please do not do that."""
1074,1.346,"my voice sounded prissy in my ears, privileged, apologetic, lacking all authority."
1075,1.1019999999999999,i was already doubting where this could lead.
1076,-0.14800000000000008,"not to a future of reformed, kindly parenting."
1077,-0.6799999999999999,"but at least, as she turned towards me in disbelief, her assault had ceased."
1078,2.556,"it was the right question and for that reason i did not answer it. """
1079,0.138,"he is too little to understand you."""
1080,-0.85,this conversation was proceeding over the child's screams.
1081,-0.81,"now he clutched at his mother's skirts, wanting to be picked up."
1082,-0.87,this was the worst of it.
1083,0.327,his tormentor was also his only comfort.
1084,0.0,she was squaring up to me.
1085,0.042,the dropped cigarette smouldered by her foot.
1086,0.6610000000000001,her right hand clenched and unclenched.
1087,0.43699999999999994,"trying to appear not to, i took a vague half-step back."
1088,-2.1100000000000003,we were staring each other out.
1089,4.451,"it was, or had been, a rather lovely, intelligent face, its obvious beauty marred by weight gain plumping up the flesh round her eyes, narrowing them into a look of suspicion."
1090,2.737,"in another life it could have been a kindly, maternal face."
1091,2.029,"rounded, high cheekbones, a slew of freckles across the bridge of her nose, full lips--though the lower was split."
1092,-0.03,"after several seconds, i noticed that her pupils were pinpricks."
1093,0.765,she was the first to shift her gaze.
1094,-0.1409999999999999,she was looking over my shoulder and then i found out why.
1095,0.0,"she yelled, ""oi, john."""
1096,0.0,i turned.
1097,2.1210000000000004,"her friend or husband, john, also plump, naked from the waist, bright pink from a bout in the sun, was on his way through the playground's wire gate."

1099,-0.01000000000000012,in some other sector of all imagined possibilities--the cinematic would be one-i need not have worried.
1100,-0.7929999999999999,"john was about my age, but shorter, flabbier, less fit, less strong."

1102,-0.21599999999999991,"but in this world, i would never hit another person in my life, not even in childhood."
1103,0.52,i could have told myself that if i knocked the father down the child would suffer all the more.
1104,0.0,but that was not it.
1105,-0.622,"i had the wrong attitude, or rather, i lacked the right one."
1106,0.42799999999999994,"it was not fear, it certainly was not lofty principle."
1107,0.379,"when it came to hitting people, i did not know where to begin."
1108,0.138,i did not want to know.
1109,1.267,"now john was squaring up to me, the woman having stepped back."
1110,-0.19200000000000006,the boy continued to wail.
1111,0.027,"father and son were comically alike--both crop-haired, ginger-blond, with small faces and wide-apart green eyes."
1112,-0.51,"he should not be hit or shaken."""
1113,-0.76,"or else."""
1114,-0.363,and john did look ready to hit me.
1115,-0.04699999999999993,"his chest was puffed out, the ancient self-enlargement ploy of toads and apes and many others."
1116,2.154,his breathing was rapid and his arms hung well clear of his torso.
1117,-1.017,"i may have been stronger, but he would be more reckless."

1134,-0.13899999999999996,the child had gone quiet by this point.
1135,1.524,"looking at him again, i thought he had something his father lacked, though perhaps not his mother--a faint but still luminous signal in his expression of intelligent engagement, despite his distress."
1136,-0.017,we stood in a tight little group.

1406,0.6660000000000001,"i noted that a certain blankness had gone from his face, that he seemed more intact, smoother in his interactions with us and certainly more expressive."
1407,1.217,"but i struggled to understand what it told me about miranda or, for that matter, about myself."
1408,1.301,"in humans, recombination is infinitely subtle and then crudely but disarmingly lopsided."
1409,3.575,"the parents merge, like fluids stirred together, but the mother's face might be faithfully replicated in her child just as the father fails to pass on his gift for comedy."
1410,0.592,i remembered little mark's touching version of his father's features.
1411,0.604,"but in adam's personality, miranda and i were well shuffled, and as in humans, his inheritance was thickly overlaid by his capacity to learn."
1412,-0.5640000000000001,perhaps he had my tendency to pointless theorising.
1413,0.32999999999999985,"perhaps he had something of miranda's secretive nature and her self-possession, her taste for solitude."
1414,-0.6,"frequently he withdrew into himself, humming or murmuring ""ah!"""
1415,1.572,then he would pronounce what he took to be an important truth.
1416,0.6469999999999999,his interrupted remark about the afterlife was the earliest example.
1417,-0.54,"another was when we were outside, in my tiny fraction of a back garden, marked off by a broken picket fence."
1418,-0.55,he was helping to pull up weeds.
1419,0.1330000000000002,"it was just before sunset, the air was still and warm, suffused by an unreal amber light."
1420,0.1,a week had passed since our late-night exchange.
1421,-1.0139999999999998,i had brought him outside because his dexterity was still a matter of interest to me.
1422,1.303,i wanted to watch him handle a hoe and a rake.
1423,0.6000000000000001,"more generally, my plan was to introduce him to the world beyond the kitchen table."
1424,2.69,we had friendly neighbours on both sides and there was a chance that he could test his small-talk skills.
1425,2.037,"if we were to travel together to salisbury to meet maxfield blacke, i wanted to prepare adam by taking him to some shops, and perhaps a pub."
1426,1.919,"i was sure he could pass off as a person, but he needed to be more at ease, his machine-learning capacities needed stretching."
1427,0.1120000000000001,i was keen to see how good he was at identifying plants.
1428,-0.698,of course he knew everything.
1429,-0.83,"feverfew, wild carrot, camomile."
1430,1.439,"as he worked, he muttered the names, for his own rather than my benefit."
1431,0.7110000000000001,i saw him put on gardening gloves to pull up nettles.
1432,0.053,mere mimicry.
1433,1.0489999999999997,later he straightened and looked with apparent interest towards a spectacular western sky intersected by power and telephone lines and a receding jumble of victorian roofs.
1434,1.8999999999999997,"his hands were on his hips and he leaned back, as though his lower back was giving him trouble."
1435,2.15,he took a deep breath to indicate his appreciation of the evening air.
1436,0.39,"then, out of nowhere, he said, ""from a certain point of view, the only solution to suffering would be the complete extinction of humankind."""
1437,-2.2199999999999998,"yes, this was why he needed to be out and about."
1438,-0.617,buried within his circuitry there was probably a set of sub-routines: sociability/conversation
1439,0.616,but i decided to join in.
1440,0.244,"utilitarianism can be logically absurd."""
1441,0.619,"he replied, ""obviously!"""
1442,-0.706,in an abrupt manner.
1443,-0.7380000000000001,"i looked at him, surprised, and he turned away from me and bent again to his work."
1444,-0.06600000000000006,"adam's insights, even when valid, were socially inept."
1445,0.155,"on our first expedition away from home, we walked the 200 yards to our local newsagent, mr. syed."
1446,-0.32799999999999996,we passed a few people in the street and no one gave adam a second glance.
1447,0.494,that was satisfying.
1448,-1.358,"over bare skin he was wearing a tight yellow jumper, knitted by my mother in her last year."
1449,0.0779999999999999,"he had white jeans and canvas loafers, bought for him by miranda."
1450,0.778,she had promised to buy him a complete outfit of his own.
1451,2.9650000000000003,"with his neat muscular bulge of chest and arms, he could have passed for a personal trainer from the local gym."
1452,1.2830000000000001,"where the pavement narrowed between a tree and a garden wall, i saw how he stood aside to let a woman with a pushchair through."
1453,0.247,"as we neared the shop he said, somewhat absurdly, ""it is good to get out."""
1454,0.185,simon syed had grown up in a large village thirty miles north of calcutta.
1455,2.2019999999999995,"his english teacher at his school had been an anglophile, a martinet who had beaten into his pupils a courteous and precise english."
1456,0.167,i had never asked simon how or why he had taken on a christian forename.
1457,-0.5750000000000002,"perhaps a desire to integrate, or the parting insistence of his formidable teacher."
1458,0.07499999999999998,he had arrived in north clapham from calcutta in his late teens and immediately went to work in his uncle's shop.
1459,-0.17700000000000002,"thirty years later, the uncle had died and the shop passed to the nephew, who still supported his aunt from the proceeds."
1460,-0.29699999999999993,"he also supported a wife and three grown-up children, but he did not like to talk about them."
1461,0.10300000000000001,"he was a muslim, by culture rather than practice."
1462,1.471,"if there was sadness in his life, it was well concealed behind a dignified manner."
1463,0.802,"now in his mid-sixties, he was sleek, bald, very correct, with a small moustache that tawhispered to sharp points."
1464,0.03600000000000003,"there was an anthropology journal, not available on the internet, that he kept for me."
1465,-1.29,he did not mind when i came in to scan the world's front pages during the task force days.
1466,0.44000000000000017,he was amused by my taste for low-grade chocolate--those global brands invented between two world wars.
1467,1.5699999999999998,"in the mid-afternoons, after hours at my screen, i craved sugar."
1468,0.06699999999999992,"in that strange way by which one reserves intimacies for a mere acquaintance, i had told simon about my new girlfriend."
1469,0.824,"when she and i had been in the shop together, he had seen for himself."
1470,-0.05300000000000005,"now, whenever i came by, his first question was always, ""how are matters proceeding?"""
1471,1.072,"he liked to tell me, on the basis of nothing but kindness, ""it is clear."
1472,0.572,her fate is you.
1473,-0.73,no dodging it!
1474,0.974,eternal happiness for you both.
1475,1.2850000000000001,he was old enough to be my father and wanted for me what had eluded him.
1476,-0.87,"there were no other customers when adam and i entered the cramped shop with its compound scent of newsprint, peanut dust and cheap toiletries."
1477,0.07700000000000007,simon rose from the wooden chair he sat on behind the till.
1478,0.17700000000000005,"because i was not alone, he would not be asking the usual question."
1479,0.111,"i made the introduction. """
1480,0.0,simon.
1481,0.645,"my friend adam."""
1482,0.0,simon nodded.
1483,0.487,"adam said, ""hello,"" and smiled."
1484,0.387,i was reassured.
1485,0.771,a good start.
1486,0.826,"if simon had noticed the strange appearance of adam's eyes, he did not show it."
1487,1.074,"it was a common reaction, i would soon discover."
1488,-1.655,people assumed a congenital deformity and politely looked away.
1489,0.09200000000000008,simon and i discussed the cricket--three consecutive sixes and a pitch invasion at the india--
1490,0.0,england t20-
1491,3.09,"they would be instantly familiar to him, their commercial histories, market share, nutritional value."
1492,0.498,"but as we chatted, it was obvious he was not looking at tins of peas, or anything at all."
1493,0.659,his face was frozen.
1494,-0.03,he had not moved in two minutes.
1495,-0.2450000000000001,i worried that something unusual or unpleasant was about to happen.
1496,0.0,simon politely pretended he had not noticed.
1497,0.867,it was possible that adam had put himself in rest mode.
1498,-0.358,i made a mental note: he was in need of an appearance of plausibility whenever doing nothing.
1499,-0.034,"his eyes were open, but he failed to blink."
1500,-2.266,perhaps i had brought him out into the world too soon.
1501,1.512,"simon would be offended that i had tried to pass off adam as a person, a friend."
1502,-0.6639999999999999,"it could look like mockery, a tasteless joke."
1503,1.884,i would have betrayed a pleasant acquaintance.
1504,-1.65,the cricket banter began to falter.
1505,-0.04,"simon's gaze settled on adam, then returned to me."
1506,0.514,"he said tactfully, ""your anthropos is in."""
1507,-0.35600000000000004,"it was my prompt to go over to the magazines, where adam stood."
1508,2.4530000000000003,"years ago, simon had cleared his top shelf of soft porn in favour of specialist stuff--literary magazines, academic bulletins of international relations, history, entomology."
1509,-0.19599999999999995,"a fair number of ageing, down-at-heel intellectuals lived in the neighbourhood."
1510,0.31299999999999994,"as i turned away he added, ""you can get it yourself?"""
1511,-0.63,a gentle tease to lower the tension.
1512,0.571,simon was taller and he usually reached up for me.
1513,0.9850000000000001,a single word brought adam to life.
1514,0.752,"with the faintest whirring sound, which i hoped only i could hear, he turned to address simon in formal terms."
1515,0.638,there is a coincidence.
1516,1.3969999999999998,i have been giving some thought lately to the mystery of the self.
1517,0.829,some say it is an organic element or process embedded in neural structures.
1518,-1.0010000000000001,"others insist that it is an illusion, a by-product of our narrative tendencies."""
1519,0.9139999999999999,"there was a silence, then, stiffening a little, simon said, ""well, sir, which is it?"
1520,1.1989999999999998,"what have you decided?"""
1521,0.747,i am bound to conclude that i have a very powerful sense of self
1522,-0.5440000000000002,and i am certain that it is real and that neuroscience will describe it fully one day.
1523,0.571,"even when it does, i will not know this self any better than i do now."
1524,1.858,"but i do have moments of doubt when i wonder whether i am subject to a form of cartesian error."""
1525,0.18499999999999997,by this time i had the journal in my hands and was preparing to leave.
1526,0.008000000000000007,i would like to meet one.
1527,0.655,"do you know any?"""
1528,-0.64,simon was emphatic.
1529,0.087,"no, sir."
1530,0.517,"absolutely, i do not."""
1531,0.738,"i raised a hand in farewell and thanks and, taking adam by his elbow, guided him towards the door."
1532,0.8959999999999999,"it was a cliche of romantic love, but no less painful for that: the stronger my feelings, the more remote and unattainable miranda appeared."
1533,-0.991,"how could i complain when she was attained that very first night, after dinner?"
1534,0.858,we had fun
1535,0.821,"but i was greedy for more, though i tried not to show it."
1536,1.641,"i wanted her to open up to me, to want me, need me, show some hunger for me, some delight in me."
1537,1.182,"instead, my initial impression held--"
1538,0.166,she could take me or leave me.
1539,1.485,"everything good that passed between us--sex, food, movies, new plays--was instigated by me."
1540,1.629,"without me she drifted in silence towards her default condition upstairs, to a book on the corn laws, a bowl of cereal, a cup of weak herbal tea, curled up in an armchair, barefoot and oblivious."
1541,1.126,sometimes she sat for long periods without a book.
1542,0.33599999999999997,"if i put my head round her door (we now had keys to each other's places) and said, ""how about an hour of frantic sex?"
1543,-0.32199999999999995,when we were done she would take a shower and return to her chair.
1544,-0.76,unless i suggested something else.
1545,1.165,"a glass of wine, a risotto, an almost famous sax player at a stockwell pub."
1546,0.089,ok again.
1547,-0.597,"to everything i proposed, indoors or out, she brought the same tranquil readiness."
1548,1.7970000000000002,happy to hold my hand.
1549,0.846,"but there was something, or many things, i did not understand, or she did not want me to know about."
1550,-0.45200000000000007,"whenever she had a seminar or needed to use the library, she returned from college in the late afternoons."
1551,0.03299999999999992,once a week she came back later.
1552,0.8049999999999999,it took me a while to notice that it was always a friday.
1553,1.313,finally she told me that she went to the regent's park mosque for friday prayers.
1554,0.353,that surprised me.
1555,0.20999999999999996,"but no, she was not thinking of converting from atheism."
1556,0.66,she had in mind a social-history paper she might write.
1557,-0.405,"i was not convinced, but i let it go."
1558,1.197,what we lacked was conversational intimacy.
1559,-0.622,we were closest when we argued about the task force.
1560,1.2349999999999999,"when we went to a bar, her conversation was general."
1561,1.5510000000000002,"she was happy with her solitude or with lively chat about public matters, but there was nothing personal in between, except her father's health or his literary career."
1562,1.5499999999999998,"when i tried to ease us towards the past, perhaps angling in gently with something about myself or a question about her own history, she reached quickly for generalities or an account of the earliest years of her childhood, or an anecdote about someone she knew."
1563,0.7489999999999998,"i told her about my idiotic excursion into tax fraud, my experience of court and the tedium of my hours of community service."
1564,0.12399999999999994,"i would have told her anyway, but the story was my pretext to ask if she herself had ever been in court."
1565,-0.19299999999999995,the answer was abrupt.
1566,0.0,never!
1567,-0.709,and then she changed the subject.
1568,1.9890000000000005,"i would been in various promising affairs and in love, or almost in love, two or three times before, depending on definitions."
1569,3.0149999999999997,i fancied myself an expert and knew better than to put her under pressure.
1570,-0.758,i still thought i might get more out of adam on the salisbury affair.
1571,0.11399999999999999,"if i did not know her secret, at least she did not know i knew she had one."
1572,0.802,tact was everything.
1573,-1.232,"i still had not told her that i loved her, or divulged my fantasies about our shared future or even hinted at my frustration."
1574,0.10000000000000009,i left her alone with her books or her thoughts whenever it suited her.
1575,3.077,"though the subject was not in the line of my interests, i worked up an acquaintance with the corn laws and developed some ideas of my own about free trade."
1576,-0.85,"she did not dismiss them, but nor was she impressed."
1577,-0.474,"so here we were upstairs at dinner in her kitchen, which was even smaller than mine."
1578,0.8269999999999997,"the table was of white moulded plastic, just big enough for two, probably stolen from a pub garden by a previous tenant."
1579,0.895,"standing at the sink, up to his elbows in suds, adam dealt with the plates and cutlery"
1580,0.061,"we would handed him at the end of our meal--toad-in-the-hole, baked beans, fried eggs."
1581,-0.5539999999999999,student food.
1582,-1.4500000000000002,"on the windowsill, where yellow gingham curtains hung still in our late-summer heat wave, a radio was playing the beatles, recently regrouped after twelve years apart."
1583,2.2279999999999998,"their album, love and lemons, had been derided for its grandiosity, for failing to resist the lure and overreach of an eighty-strong symphony orchestra."
1584,1.867,"they could not master such forces, was the general drift, with half a lifetime's store of guitar chords."
1585,2.682,"nor did we wish to be told again, the times critic complained, that love was all we needed, even if it were true, which it was not."
1586,1.293,"but i liked the music's muscular sentimentality, emptied of irony by these middle-aged performers, so confident and tuneful, liberated by useful ignorance of two and a half centuries of symphonic experimentation."
1587,0.39700000000000013,"lennon's rasping voice floated towards us from some faraway echoing place beyond the horizon, or the grave."
1588,0.9390000000000001,i did not mind being told again about love.
1589,0.8039999999999999,"here before me were all of its warm possibilities, barely three feet away, and it was all i needed."
1590,0.7110000000000001,"here was her long, exquisitely shaped face (those angled cheekbones might break through the skin one day), the amused gaze, at this point still merry, and narrowed, locked on me, the lips parted, for she was about to speak against what i would just said."
1591,0.9159999999999998,her perfect elongated nose flared faintly at the base of the nostrils' arch to signal in advance her dissent.
1592,0.14900000000000013,"her pallor set off her fine brown hair, tonight childishly parted dead centre."
1593,-1.7299999999999998,"against prevailing fashion, she kept out of the sun."
1594,-2.638,her bare white arms were also thin and unblemished--not a single freckle.
1595,-0.24799999999999997,"from my point of view we still holidayed in the foothills, among possibilities whose fulfilment rose like distant alps."
1596,-0.5249999999999999,i tried to ignore them in order to attend to details.
1597,-0.07900000000000022,"from her perspective, on the other side of this frail table, we may have already reached our highest point."
1598,2.322,"she may have thought she was as close as she ever wanted to be, or could be, to another person."
1599,2.222,love stories like jane austen's used to conclude chastely with preparations for a wedding.
1600,1.791,"now their climax lay on the far side of carnal knowledge, where all of complexity waited."
1601,2.036,"for now, my business was to conduct a political argument with her without feelings running high, then turning sour, and at the same time stay true to myself and let her do the same."
1602,-0.3179999999999997,"it was a feasible balancing act, as long as i drank less than half a bottle of the indifferent medoc that stood between us."
1603,1.359,"we would had this conversation before and it should have been easier now, but repetition seemed like an indictment of us both."
1604,-0.75,we did not really want to be talking about it.
1605,-0.9570000000000001,"impossible to avoid, even though we knew it would lead nowhere."
1606,-0.18900000000000006,but this was how it was for everyone.
1607,-1.163,we were all still tending the wound.
1608,1.346,how could miranda and i spend our lives together when we could not agree on such a fundamental as war?
1609,0.563,about the islands formerly known as the falklands she had firm views.
1610,0.29000000000000004,she insisted that the argentine flag-planting on remote south georgia had been a clear violation of international law.
1611,-1.747,i said it was an inhospitable place and no one should be asked to fight to the death for it.
1612,1.7650000000000001,she said that the taking of port stanley was the desperate act of an unpopular regime looking to whip up patriotic fervour.
1613,0.7479999999999999,i said this was all the more reason not to get drawn in.
1614,0.25399999999999995,"she said the task force was a brave and brilliant conception, even in failure."
1615,-0.4449999999999999,"i said, uneasily remembering my emotional state when the ships set off, that it was a ridiculous enactment of lost imperial grandeur."
1616,-0.842,"how could i not see, she said, that this was an antifascist war?"
1617,-1.0869999999999997,"no (i spoke over her), it was a row over property, fed on each side by nationalistic stupidity."
1618,0.762,i summoned the borges observation: two bald men fighting over a comb.
1619,0.8390000000000001,she replied that a bald man might hand down his comb to his children.
1620,-0.443,"i was struggling to understand this when she added that the generals had tortured, disappeared and killed their citizens by the thousands and were running the economy into the ground."
1621,2.8520000000000003,"if we would taken back the islands, the humiliation would have finished the military regime and democracy would have returned to argentina."
1622,-0.622,i replied that she could not possibly know this.
1623,-0.07099999999999995,we had lost thousands of young men and women to the because of mrs. thatcher's ambitions.
1624,0.098,my voice began to rise before i remembered.
1625,1.432,i resumed quietly but with a certain tremor: that she remained in office after such slaughter was the greatest political scandal of our time.
1626,3.391,"i delivered this with a finality that deserved a moment's respectful silence, but miranda came straight back to tell me that the prime minister failed in a decent because and was supported by almost all of parliament and the country and she was right to remain in office."
1627,2.4469999999999996,"during this conversation, adam finished with the dishes and stood with his back to the kitchen sink to watch us, arms folded, his head turning from side to side, speaker to speaker, like a spectator at a tennis match."
1628,2.025,"our exchange was not exactly weary, but repetition had given it an air of ritual."
1629,1.392,"like facing armies, we would taken up our positions and intended to hold them."
1630,-1.603,miranda was telling me that the task force set off without proper ship-to-air missiles.
1631,-0.04899999999999999,the chiefs of staff let the armed forces down.
1632,1.707,"i used to hear terms like these--ship-toair, homing devices, titanium-tipped--at the warwickshire student union bar, but only from men, men of the political left, whose opinions were complicated by tacit admiration for the weapon systems they condemned."
1633,2.318,"in her soft and fluent delivery, she mingled these with other concepts from the lexicon of established power--the open society, rule of law, restoration of democracy."
1634,-0.8019999999999999,perhaps it was her father i was hearing.
1635,1.4889999999999999,"while she was speaking, i turned to catch adam's expression."
1636,1.256,what i saw was his devoted attention.
1637,0.0,more than that.
1638,0.8879999999999999,a look of delight.
1639,0.0,he adored what she was saying.
1640,0.8509999999999998,"i turned back to miranda as she reminded me that the falklanders were my fellow citizens, now living under fascism."
1641,0.298,was i happy with that?
1642,-1.222,i disliked this rhetorical turn.
1643,-0.91,it was a masked insult.
1644,0.989,"the conversation was turning sour, just as i would feared, but i could not help myself."
1645,0.435,"in the tiny kitchen space, i was hot and irritable as i reached for the wine and filled my glass."
1646,1.329,"there could have been a negotiated settlement, i started to say."
1647,-0.718,"a slow and painless thirty-year transition, a un mandate, guaranteed rights."
1648,1.603,she interrupted to inform me that we could never trust any undertaking by the murdering generals.
1649,-0.7390000000000001,"as she said it, i saw them in caricature, in braided hats, campaign ribbons, cavalry boots, and galtieri on his white horse in a confetti blizzard on the avenida 25 de mayo."
1650,-1.431,i said that i accepted every last one of her arguments.
1651,0.255,"the forces set off on their 8,000-mile mission, her risky strategy was tested and it failed."
1652,-0.7009999999999998,"thousands she never knew or cared about were drowned or burned to death, or live on, maimed, disfigured, traumatised."
1653,0.74,we have arrived at the worst outcome: the junta possessed the island and its inhabitants.
1654,-0.5730000000000001,"whereas a policy of slow, negotiated agreement was not tested, but if it had failed we would have reached the same outcome, without the agony and death."
1655,0.138,we could not know.
1656,0.684,what might have happened was lost to us.
1657,-0.81,so what was there to argue about?
1658,0.6050000000000001,"i saw that the glass i would filled, and had no memory of touching, was empty."
1659,-0.76,and i was wrong.
1660,-0.050000000000000044,"there was plenty to argue about, for"
1661,1.432,"even as i said it, i knew i was crossing a line."
1662,-0.9609999999999999,"i had accused her of not caring about the dead, and she was angry."
1663,0.6290000000000001,"her eyes were narrowed, without merriment, but she did not address my transgression."
1664,0.516,"instead, she turned to adam and asked quietly, ""what is your view?"""
1665,0.823,his gaze travelled from her to me and back.
1666,-0.982,i still did not know whether he actually saw anything.
1667,0.6779999999999999,"an image on some internal screen that no one was watching, or some diffused circuitry to orient his body in three-dimensional space?"
1668,0.5850000000000002,"seeming to see could be a blind trick of imitation, a social manoeuvre to fool us into projecting onto him a human quality."
1669,1.313,"but i could not help it: when our eyes briefly met and i looked into the blue irises flecked with spears of black, the moment appeared rich with meaning, with anticipation."
1670,1.689,"i wanted to know whether he understood, as i did, and as miranda surely did, that the issue here was loyalty."

1675,0.737,"without benefit of hindsight, we would have to choose which causes to pursue, which to avoid."
1676,1.3159999999999998,we would be in the realm of bayesian inverse probability.
1677,0.17300000000000004,we would be looking for the probable because of an effect rather than the most likely effect of a because.
1678,1.254,"only sensible, to try and find a formal representation of our guesswork."
1679,1.351,"our reference point, our datum, would be an observer of the falklands situation before any decisions were taken."
1680,0.857,certain a priori probability values are ascribed to the four outcomes.
1681,2.187,"as fresh information comes in, we can measure relative changes in probability."
1682,1.196,but we can not possess an absolute value.

1688,0.571,now it was miranda who reached for the medoc.

1699,0.10899999999999999,miranda and i had different states of mind.
1700,0.653,what was new?
1701,-0.59,but we were united against adam in our differences.
1702,-0.463,"at least, this was my hope."
1703,4.1739999999999995,"he may have understood the relevant issue after all: he thought i was right about the falklands and, given a degree of programmed intellectual honesty, the best he could offer miranda, to whom he was also loyal, was an appearance of neutrality."
1704,2.116,"but if that was sound, why not accept the mirror possibility, that he believed miranda was right"
1705,0.485,and i was the one in receipt of loyal support?
1706,-0.867,"with a sudden scrape of a kitchen chair, miranda stood."
1707,1.8890000000000002,there was a faint flush about her face and throat
1708,0.521,and she was not looking at me.
1709,-1.34,we would be sleeping in separate beds that night.
1710,-0.14299999999999996,i would have happily unsaid my entire argument to stay with her.
1711,-0.55,but i was dumb.
1712,0.274,"she said to adam, ""you can stay up here to charge, if you like."""
1713,0.2729999999999999,adam needed six hours a night connected to a thirteenamp socket.
1714,0.605,"he went into sleep mode and sat quietly ""reading"" until after dawn."
1715,0.028,"usually he was in my kitchen downstairs, but recently miranda had bought a second charging cable."
1716,1.0950000000000002,"he murmured his thanks and slowly folded a kitchen towel in half with close attention, hunched over the task, and spread it across the draining board."
1717,4.543,"as she moved towards her bedroom door she shot me a look, a regretful smile that did not part her lips, sent a conciliatory kiss across the space between us and whispered, ""just for tonight."""
1718,0.131,so we were fine.
1719,-0.249,"i said, ""of course i know you care about the dead."""
1720,0.67,she nodded and left.
1721,0.7240000000000001,"adam was sitting down, pulling his shirt clear of his belt to locate the tethering point below his waistline."
1722,1.2919999999999998,i put a hand on his shoulder and thanked him for clearing up.
1723,0.9679999999999999,"for me, it was far too early for bed"
1724,-0.05900000000000005,"and it was hot, like a summer evening in marrakech."
1725,0.947,i went downstairs and looked in the fridge for something cool.
1726,-0.3859999999999999,"i remained in the kitchen, in an old leather armchair, with a balloon glass of moldovan white."
1727,0.6579999999999999,there was much pleasure in following a line of thought without opposition.
1728,-1.081,"i was hardly the first to think it, but one could see the history of human self-regard as a series of demotions tending to extinction."
1729,0.2660000000000001,"once we sat enthroned at the centre of the universe, with sun and planets, the entire observable world, turning around us in an ageless dance of worship."
1730,-1.029,"then, in defiance of the priests, heartless astronomy reduced us to an orbiting planet around the sun, just one among other rocks."
1731,0.007999999999999952,"but still we stood apart, brilliantly unique, appointed by the creator to be lords of everything that lived."
1732,0.805,"then biology confirmed that we were at one with the rest, sharing common ancestry with bacteria, pansies, trout and sheep."
1733,-0.21399999999999986,"in the early twentieth century came deeper exile into darkness when the immensity of the universe was revealed and even the sun became one among billions in our galaxy, among billions of galaxies."
1734,-0.207,"finally, in consciousness, our last redoubt, we were probably correct to believe that we had more of it than any creature on earth."
1735,-1.0409999999999995,but the mind that had once rebelled against the gods was about to dethrone itself by way of its own fabulous reach.
1736,3.6130000000000004,"in the compressed version, we would devise a machine a little cleverer than ourselves, then set that machine to invent another that lay beyond our comprehension."
1737,-0.21899999999999997,what need then of us?
1738,1.215,"such hot-air thoughts deserved a second, bigger balloon and i poured it."
1739,1.5620000000000003,"head propped in my right palm, i approached that ill-lit precinct where self-pity becomes a mellow pleasure."
1740,0.604,"i was a special case of the general banishment, though it was not adam"
1741,0.74,i was thinking of.
1742,0.0,he was not cleverer than me.
1743,0.0,not yet.
1744,-1.64,"no, my exile was for one night only and it gave a twist of sweet, bearable agony to a hopeless love."
1745,-0.4590000000000001,"my shirt unbuttoned to the waist, all windows open, the urban romance of getting thoughtfully drunk amid the heat and dust and muted din of north clapham, in a world city."
1746,-1.14,the imbalance of our affair was heroic.
1747,-0.24699999999999997,i imagined an onlooker's approving gaze from a corner of the room.
1748,-0.038999999999999924,that well-formed figure slumped in his beaten-up chair.
1749,0.658,i rather loved myself.
1750,0.0,someone had to.
1751,0.846,"i rewarded myself with thoughts of her, mid-ecstasy, and considered the impersonal quality of her pleasures."
1752,2.384,"i was only good enough for her, as many men might be."
1753,0.23199999999999987,"i refused the obvious, that her distance was the whip that drove my longing."
1754,-0.26,but here was something strange.
1755,0.61,"three days before, she had asked a mysterious question."
1756,0.9500000000000001,"we were mid-embrace, in the conventional position."
1757,0.679,she drew my face towards hers.
1758,0.061,her look was serious.
1759,0.099,"she whispered, ""tell me something."
1760,0.0,"are you real?"""
1761,0.559,i did not reply.
1762,-0.62,she turned her head away so that i saw her in profile as her eyes closed
1763,-0.2280000000000001,and she lost herself once more in a maze of private pleasure.
1764,-0.55,"later that night, i asked her about it."
1765,0.0,was i real?
1766,3.9720000000000004,"meaning did i really love her, or was i honest, or did i fit her needs so exactly that she might have dreamed me up?"
1767,0.728,i crossed the kitchen to pour the last of the wine.
1768,-0.20700000000000013,the broken fridge door handle needed a sharp sideways pull to engage its lock.
1769,0.992,"as my hand closed round the cold neck of the bottle, i heard a sound, a creak above my head."
1770,0.988,i had lived long enough beneath miranda's feet to know her steps and their precise direction.
1771,0.7559999999999999,she had moved across her bedroom and was hesitating in the threshold of her kitchen.
1772,0.043,i heard the murmur of her voice.
1773,0.559,no reply.
1774,-0.004,she took another two steps into the room.
1775,0.5379999999999999,the next would bring her onto a floorboard that under pressure made a truncated quacking sound.
1776,0.032,"as i waited to hear it, adam spoke."
1777,0.253,he pushed his chair back as he stood.
1778,-1.385,if he was to take another step he would need to untether himself.
1779,0.49699999999999994,this he must have achieved because it was his tread that landed on the noisy floorboard.
1780,1.7000000000000002,"that meant they were standing less than a metre apart, but there was no sound until a minute had passed, and now it was footsteps, two sets, moving back towards the bedroom."
1781,1.379,i left the fridge door open because the sound of it closing would betray me.
1782,-0.26,no choice but to shadow them into my bedroom.
1783,0.076,so i went and stood by my desk and listened.
1784,0.886,"i reckoned i was right under her bed when i heard the murmur of her voice, a command."
1785,3.178,"she must have wanted air in the room, for adam's steps tracked across the room towards the victorian bay."
1786,-0.79,only one of its three windows opened.
1787,0.458,even that one was hard to shift on a warm or rainy day.
1788,-1.52,"the old wooden frames shrank or expanded, and something was wrong with the counterweight and hardened rope."
1789,-2.468,"our age could devise a passable replica of a human mind, but there was no one in our neighbourhood to fix a sash window, though a few had tried."
1790,1.247,"and how was my mind as i stood directly below, in an identical bay, reproduced by the thousands in late-victorian industrial-scale developments?"
1791,0.767,they had spilled across the five-acre fields of hedgerow and boundary oaks that adorned the southern limits of london.
1792,0.072,"not good--my mind, that is."
1793,0.597,"embodied, it told all."
1794,1.276,"shivering, moist, especially on the palms, raised pulse, in a state of elated anticipation."
1795,-0.78,"fear, self-doubt, fury."
1796,0.6650000000000001,"in my bay, old fitted carpet, stained and worn since the mid-fifties, extended right to the skirting boards."
1797,0.05899999999999983,"in miranda's, the carpet gave way to bare boards that, two world wars back, must have been polished to a nut-brown gleam."
1798,1.8680000000000003,"some poor girl in white apron and mob cap, on all fours, waxed cloth in hand, never could have dreamed of the kind of being who would one day stand in the place where she crouched."
1799,-0.6330000000000001,"i heard him plant his feet on the old wood, i imagined him stooping to grip the window by the metal fixtures on its lower frame and heave upwards with the strength of four young men."
1800,-2.828,there was a silence of straining resistance before the entire window shot upwards and hit the top casing with a rifle crack and a shattering of glass.
1801,1.02,my snort of delight could have given me away.
1802,-1.523,no shortage now of marginally cooler air filling the room.
1803,-0.23900000000000005,my glee faded as adam's footsteps returned to where miranda waited by the bed.
1804,1.272,"as he went towards her, it might have been an apology that he muttered."
1805,2.377,"here was the sound of her forgiving him, for her brief sentence was followed by the entwined mezzo and tenor of their laughter."
1806,-0.7180000000000001,"i had trailed after adam and was once more by the bed, six feet under."
1807,0.547,he had the manual skills to undress her
1808,0.0,and he was undressing her now.
1809,-1.2319999999999998,what else would occupy their silence?
1810,-0.709,i knew--of course i knew--that her mattress made no sound.
1811,3.084,"futons, with their japanese promise of a clean and simple life of stripped-back clarity, were the fashion then."
1812,0.16700000000000004,"and i myself felt washed in clarity, senses cleansed as i stood in the dark and waited."
1813,0.4360000000000002,"i could have run up the stairs and prevented them, burst into the bedroom like the clownish husband in an old seaside postcard."
1814,3.3680000000000003,"but my situation had a thrilling aspect, not only of subterfuge and discovery, but of originality, of modern precedence, of being the first to be cuckolded by an artefact."
1815,0.6940000000000002,"i was of my times, riding the breaking crest of the new, ahead of everyone in enacting that drama of displacement so frequently and gloomily predicted."
1816,-1.096,"another element of my passivity: even at this earliest moment, i knew i had brought the whole thing down on myself."
1817,0.571,but that was for later.
1818,0.46999999999999986,"for now, despite the horror of betrayal, it was all too interesting"
1819,-1.125,"and i could not stir from my role of eavesdropper, the blind voyeur, humiliated and alert."
1820,1.564,"it was my mind's eyes, or my heart's, that watched as adam and miranda lay down on the unyielding embrace of the futon and found the comfortable posture for a clasp of limbs."
1821,0.9520000000000001,"i watched as she whiswhispered in his ear, but i did not hear the words."
1822,1.461,she had never whiswhispered in my ear at such times.
1823,0.8280000000000001,i saw him kiss her--longer and deeper than i had ever kissed her.
1824,0.05099999999999999,the arms that heaved up the window frame were tightly around her.
1825,0.5880000000000001,minutes later i almost looked away as he knelt with reverence to pleasure her with his tongue.
1826,2.0700000000000003,"this was the celebrated tongue, wet and breathily warm, adept at uvulars and labials, that gave his speech its authenticity."
1827,-0.367,"i watched, surprised by nothing."
1828,6.459,"he did not fully satisfy my beloved then, as i would have, but left her arching her slender back, eager for him as he arranged himself above her with smooth, slowloris formality, at which point my humiliation was complete."
1829,0.917,i saw it all in the dark--men would be obsolete.
1830,-0.702,i wanted to persuade myself that adam felt nothing and could only imitate the motions of abandonment.
1831,0.138,that he could never know what we knew.
1832,2.261,but alan turing himself had often said and written in his youth that the moment we could not tell the difference in behaviour between machine and person was when we must confer humanity on the machine.
1833,-0.55,so when the night air was suddenly penetrated by miranda's extended ecstatic scream that tawhispered to a moan and then a stifled sob--all this
1834,-0.93,i actually heard twenty minutes after the shattering of the window
1835,0.0,i hated him.
1836,2.917,"early the following morning, for the first time in years, i tipped into my coffee a heaped spoon of sugar."
1837,-0.6450000000000001,"i watched the confined, nut-brown disc of fluid turn, then slow, in its clockwise motion, then lose all purpose in a chaotic swirl."
1838,0.7239999999999999,"tempting, but i resisted a metaphor for my own existence."
1839,-0.10099999999999998,i was trying to think
1840,-0.06,and it was barely seven thirty.
1841,0.624,soon adam or miranda or both would appear at my door.
1842,1.586,i wanted my thoughts and attitude in coherent form.
1843,-0.05499999999999983,"after a night of broken sleep, i was depressed as well as angry with myself, and determined not to appear so."
1844,-2.192,"miranda had kept her distance from me and so, by contemporary standards, a night with someone else, even something else, was not quite a betrayal."
1845,0.548,"as for the ethical dimensions of adam's behaviour, here was a history with a curious beginning."
1846,-0.7610000000000003,"it was during the miners' strike of twelve years before that self-driving cars first appeared on experimental sites, mostly disused airfields, where movie set designers had constructed imitation streets, motorway junctions and various hazards."
1847,-0.9680000000000001,"if artificial intelligence was to guide these vehicles safely home, what set of values or priorities should be assumed in the software?"
1848,-0.364,"fortunately, in moral philosophy there already existed a wellexplored set of dilemmas known in the business as ""the trolley problem."
1849,-1.62,the traffic is flowing nicely.
1850,0.241,on the pavement on your side of the road is a group of children.
1851,-0.12999999999999992,"suddenly one of them, a child of eight, runs out across the road, right into your path."
1852,-0.06499999999999997,there is a fraction of a second to make a decision--either mow the child down or swerve onto the crowded pavement or into the oncoming traffic and collide head on with a truck at a closing speed of eighty miles an hour.
1853,-0.19999999999999998,"you are alone, so that is fine, sacrifice or save yourself."
1854,0.93,what if your spouse and your two children are in the car?
1855,0.269,too easy?

1857,1.145,now take into account the occupants of the truck.
1858,4.373,a fraction of a second is more than enough time for a computer to give thorough consideration to all the issues.
1859,-0.519,the decision will depend on the priorities ordered by the software.
1860,3.019,"while mounted policemen charged at miners, and manufacturing towns across the country began their long, sad descent in the because of free markets, the subject of robot ethics was born."
1861,-0.07399999999999995,"the international automobile industry consulted philosophers, judges, specialists in medical ethics, game theorists and parliamentary committees."
1862,-0.14800000000000002,"then, in universities and research institutes, the subject expanded on its own."
1863,-0.3770000000000001,"long before the hardware was available, professors and their postdocs devised software that conjured our best selves--tolerant, open-minded, considerate, free of all taint of scheming, malice or prejudice."
1864,-0.11599999999999999,"theorists anticipated a refined artificial intelligence, guided by well-designed principles, that would learn by roaming over thousands, millions, of moral dilemmas."
1865,2.847,"such intelligence could teach us how to be, how to be good."
1866,0.6320000000000001,"humans were ethically flawed--inconsistent, emotionally labile, prone to biases, to errors in cognition, many of which were selfserving."
1867,3.2380000000000004,"long before there was even a suitable lightweight battery to power an artificial human, or the elastic material to provide for its face a set of recognisable expressions, the software existed to make it decent and wise."
1868,2.243,"before we had constructed a robot that could bend and tie an old man's shoelace for him, there was hope that our own creations would redeem us."
1869,3.6149999999999993,"the life of the self-driving car was short, at least in its first manifestation, and its moral qualities were never really put to the test over time."
1870,-0.917,nothing proved more vividly the maxim that technology renders civilisation fragile than the great traffic paralyses of the late seventies.
1871,0.79,"by then, autonomous vehicles comprised seventeen per cent of the total."
1872,0.79,who can forget that roasting rush-hour evening of the manhattan logjam?
1873,0.8819999999999999,"due to an exceptional solar pulse, many on-board radars failed at once."
1874,-0.75,"streets and avenues, bridges and tunnels were blocked and took days to untangle."
1875,-1.4929999999999999,"nine months later, the similar ruhr jam in northern europe caused a short economic downturn and prompted conspiracy theories."
1876,1.363,teenage hackers with a lust for mayhem?

1878,1.2489999999999997,"or, my favourite, an unreconstructed automobile maker loathing the hot breath of the new?"
1879,-0.046,"apart from our too-busy sun, no culprit was ever found."
1880,2.089,the world's religions and great literatures demonstrated clearly that we knew how to be good.
1881,0.07200000000000012,"we set out our aspirations in poetry, prose and song, and we knew what to do."
1882,-0.07399999999999995,"the problem was in the enactment, consistently and en masse."
1883,1.687,what survived the temporary death of the autonomous car was a dream of redemptive robotic virtue.
1884,0.7050000000000001,"adam and his cohort were its early embodiment, so the user's manual implied."
1885,-0.131,he was supposed to be my moral superior.
1886,1.333,i would never meet anyone better.
1887,-0.8019999999999999,"had he been my friend, he would have been guilty of a cruel and terrible lapse."
1888,1.161,"the problem was that i had bought him, he was my expensive possession and it was not clear what his obligations to me were, beyond a vaguely assumed helpfulness."
1889,-0.3870000000000001,what does the slave owe to the owner?
1890,0.122,"also, miranda did not ""belong"" to me."
1891,0.05899999999999994,this was clear.
1892,1.518,i could hear her tell me that i had no good because to feel betrayed.
1893,-0.252,"but here was this other matter, which she and i had not yet discussed."
1894,-1.455,software engineers from the automobile industry may have helped with adam's moral maps.
1895,0.668,but together we had contributed to his personality.
1896,0.8220000000000001,"i did not know the extent to which it intruded on, or took priority over, his ethics."
1897,-0.04500000000000004,how deep did personality go?
1898,-0.526,a perfectly formed moral system should float free of any particular disposition.
1899,0.0,but could it?
1900,-2.769,"confined to a hard drive, moral software was merely the dry equivalent of the brain-in-a-dish thought experiment that once littered philosophical textbooks."
1901,0.933,"whereas an artificial human had to get down among us, imperfect, fallen us, and rub along."
1902,-0.236,hands assembled in sterile factory conditions must get dirty.
1903,0.6809999999999999,"to exist in the human moral dimension was to own a body, a voice, a pattern of behaviour, memory and desire, experience solid things and feel pain."
1904,0.36100000000000004,a perfectly honest being engaged in such a way with the world might find miranda difficult to resist.
1905,-0.7000000000000001,"through the night, i would fantasised adam's destruction."
1906,-0.04900000000000003,i saw my hands tighten around the rope i used to drag him towards the filthy river wandle.
1907,0.846,if only he had not cost me so much.
1908,0.0,now he was costing me more.
1909,1.326,his moment with miranda could not have been a struggle between principle and the pursuit of pleasure.
1910,0.252,his erotic life was a simulacrum.
1911,1.165,he cared for her as a dishwasher cares for its dishes.
1912,0.806,"he, or his sub-routines, preferred her approval to my wrath."
1913,0.55,"i also blamed miranda, who had ticked half the boxes and settled many intricacies of his nature."
1914,0.571,"and for setting her on, i blamed myself."
1915,2.041,"i would wanted to ""discover"" adam in just the way i might a new friend, and here he was, a self-declared cad."
1916,0.4770000000000001,i would wanted to bind myself closer to miranda in the process.
1917,1.506,"well, i had been thinking about her all night."
1918,1.744,it was success all round.
1919,0.0,i heard footsteps on the stairs.
1920,-0.03,two sets.
1921,1.44,i drew yesterday's newspaper and my cup towards me and prepared to appear casually absorbed.
1922,0.8919999999999999,i had my dignity to protect.
1923,0.8180000000000001,miranda's key turned in the lock.
1924,-0.4109999999999999,"as she preceded adam into the kitchen, i looked up as though reluctant to be drawn away from my reading."
1925,-1.035,i had just learned from the front page that the first permanent artificial heart had been installed in a man called barney clark.
1926,0.061,"it pained me that she seemed different, refreshed, newly arranged."
1927,0.921,it was another warm day.
1928,-0.5820000000000001,she wore a flimsy pleated skirt formed of two layers of white cheesecloth.
1929,1.297,"as she came towards me, the material brushed a line several inches above her bare knees."
1930,-0.038999999999999986,"no socks, canvas plimsolls of the sort we used to wear at school, and a cotton blouse buttoned chastely to the top."
1931,-1.2930000000000001,there was mockery in all this white.
1932,-1.08,"behind the crown of her head was a clasp i would never seen before, an ornament in bright red plastic, showily cheap."
1933,0.579,"inconceivable, that adam could have slipped out of the house to buy it for her at simon's with coins taken from the papier-mache bowl in the kitchen."
1934,-1.038,"but i conceived it, and experienced a hot jolt which i concealed behind a smile."
1935,-0.14600000000000002,i was not going to appear crushed.
1936,-0.02,adam had partly hidden himself behind her.
1937,0.6940000000000001,"now, when she stopped, he was at her side, but he would not look directly at me."
1938,1.6860000000000002,"miranda, however, appeared cheerful, with the amused pout of someone about to deliver important good news."
1939,0.5930000000000001,the kitchen table was between us
1940,0.5209999999999999,"and they stood before me where i sat, like candidates for a job."
1941,3.07,"at any other time i would have stood to embrace her, offered to make her coffee."
1942,0.781,she was a morning addict and liked it strong.
1943,-0.71,"instead, i cocked my head, met her gaze and waited."
1944,0.35100000000000003,"of course, she was dressed for tennis, the ball was in her--ah,"
1945,-0.197,how i hated my own stupid thoughts.
1946,1.401,i could not imagine any good coming from a conversation with these two.
1947,1.52,far better to contemplate barney's luck with his new heart.
1948,0.517,"she said to adam, ""why do not you . . ."""
1949,0.962,"she indicated his usual chair, and drew it back for him."
1950,0.0,he sat promptly.
1951,1.3519999999999999,"we watched as he loosened his belt, took the power lead and plugged himself in."
1952,-1.66,of course he would be much depleted.
1953,0.5529999999999999,she reached across his shoulder for the place on his nape and pressed.
1954,1.152,it was clearly by agreement.
1955,-1.2559999999999998,"as soon as his eyes closed, his head slumped, and we were alone."
1956,1.88,iranda went to the stove and prepared coffee.
1957,-0.131,"while her back was still turned she said gaily, ""charlie."
1958,-0.087,"you are being ridiculous."""
1959,0.852,she brought two cups and a jug of milk to the table.
1960,0.000999999999999994,she was swift and loose in her movements.
1961,0.748,if i had not been there she might have been singing to herself.
1962,-0.126,there was a scent of lemon about her hands.
1963,1.132,i thought she was about to touch my shoulder
1964,0.0,"and i tensed,"
1965,-0.323,but she moved away again to the other side of the room.
1966,0.9320000000000002,"after a moment she said with some delicacy, ""you heard us last night."""
1967,0.559,i did not reply.
1968,0.0,i shrugged.
1969,0.33599999999999997,"she said, ""if i would gone to bed with a vibrator would you be feeling the same?"""
1970,0.7270000000000001,she brought the coffee to the table and sat down close to me.
1971,-1.2060000000000002,"she was being kindly, concerned, in effect casting me as the sulking child, trying to make me forget that she was ten years my junior."
1972,0.14,what was passing between us was our most intimate exchange so far.
1973,-0.59,hostile?
1974,0.0,she had never before referred to any mood-state of mine.

1981,-0.266,this was comforting
1982,0.908,but i was determined to be cool.
1983,0.0,she laughed.
1984,0.8190000000000001,i had never seen her so light and free.
1985,0.534,"he is a fucking machine."""
1986,0.534,a fucking machine.

1988,0.019000000000000017,"i would not think you were having an affair."""
1989,0.584,it will happen again.
1990,-1.241,"it was a rhetorical parry, a cue for her to contradict me."
1991,-1.04,"but i was somewhat provoked by ""tragic."

2003,0.579,"enough."""
2004,-0.828,"her sarcasm, a novel register, was delivered with much variation of pitch."
2005,2.333,i thought the performance was mean in spirit.
2006,1.5030000000000001,"for all i knew, she was hiding the truth in plain sight."
2007,-0.04,she patted adam's wrist as she smiled at me.
2008,1.4800000000000002,"in triumph or by way of apology, i could not tell."
2009,-1.347,"i was bound to suspect that a night of exceptional sex was the because of this taunting, airy-headed manner."
2010,0.44700000000000006,she was harder than ever to read.
2011,-0.62,i wondered if i could break with her completely.
2012,2.885,"take back adam as my own, retrieve the spare charging cable from upstairs, restore miranda to her role as neighbour and friend, distant friend."
2013,0.7909999999999998,"in the manner of thought, the idea was no more than a spark of irritation."
2014,2.274,the notion that immediately followed was that i could never be free of her and would never want to be--most of the time.
2015,2.626,"here she was beside me, close enough for me to feel her summer-morning body warmth."
2016,-0.522,"beautiful, pale-skinned, smooth, in bridal white, gazing on me again with affectionate concern now that her teasing was done."
2017,0.714,the look was new.
2018,1.6840000000000002,"it could be--this was an encouraging thought--that a clever device had performed a service, loosening miranda's warmer feelings."
2019,2.1039999999999996,arguing with the person you love is its own peculiar torment.
2020,-0.479,the self divides against itself.

2119,-0.76,"i added, ""he is probably looked me up too."""
2120,-1.28,"with this, the row collapsed in on itself, without reconciliation or estrangement."
2121,-0.59,now we were united against adam.
2122,-0.85,but that was not my immediate concern.
2123,-1.025,"the delicate trick was to appear to know a lot in order to find out something, anything."
2124,0.9139999999999999,"i said, ""you could call it curiosity on adam's part."
2125,0.08199999999999996,"or regard it as some kind of algorithm."""
2126,0.5810000000000001,turing's point precisely.
2127,-0.72,but i said nothing.
2128,0.751,the object in her hand was a teaspoon.
2129,2.401,"she rolled it restlessly, worked it between her fingers, transferred it to her left and began again, then handed it back."
2130,0.56,she was not aware of what she was doing.
2131,0.524,it was unpleasant to watch.
2132,1.3679999999999999,how much easier it would have been if i did not love her.
2133,2.108,then i could have been alive to her needs instead of calculating my own as well.
2134,1.2999999999999998,"i had to know what had happened in court, then understand, embrace, support, forgive--whatever was required."
2135,0.327,self-interest dressed as kindness.
2136,0.327,but it was also kindness.
2137,-1.1069999999999998,my fraudulent voice sounded thin in my ears.
2138,0.852,she came back to the table and sat heavily.

2140,0.64,at last she looked at me directly.
2141,-0.8759999999999999,there was nothing sorrowful or needy in her gaze.
2142,-1.15,her eyes were hard with stubborn defiance.

2166,0.138,"i said, ""i understand."

2173,-0.678,"her parody was savage, catching too well the meagre tone of my deception."
2174,0.521,now she was looking at me differently.
2175,-0.14400000000000002,she was about to say something else.
2176,0.20400000000000001,"but just at that moment, adam opened his eyes."
2177,0.713,she must have powered him up without my noticing.
2178,0.0,"she said, ""ok."
2179,1.427,here's something you did not get from the press.
2180,0.059,i was in salisbury last month.

2190,-0.8799999999999999,"you, not we--i saw in her blink and fractional recoil how she took this in."
2191,-0.85,my phrasing was deliberate.
2192,0.881,"i would offered help several times and been brushed off, even mocked."
2193,3.6100000000000003,"now i saw just how much help she needed, i held back and let her ask for it."
2194,-0.86,perhaps she would not.
2195,-0.9530000000000001,"i conjured this gorringe, a large type, stepping from the prison gym, adept in forms of industrial violence."
2196,0.8939999999999997,"a tamping iron, a meat hook, a boiler wrench."
2197,0.521,adam was looking at me intently as he listened to miranda.
2198,0.6529999999999999,"in effect, she was asking for my assistance as she went on to describe her frustrations."
2199,-1.6420000000000001,the police were reluctant to act against a crime not yet committed.
2200,0.112,she had no proof.
2201,-0.6970000000000001,"gorringe's threat had been merely verbal, made through an intermediary."
2202,1.976,"she persisted, and finally an officer agreed to interview him."
2203,-0.030999999999999917,the prison was north of manchester and the meeting took a month to arrange.
2204,0.47500000000000003,"peter gorringe, relaxed and cheerful, charmed the police sergeant."
2205,-1.6749999999999998,"it was a joke, he had said, this talk of killing."
2206,-0.2040000000000001,"merely a manner of speaking, as in--this was in the policeman's notes--""i would kill for a chicken madras."
2207,-0.2390000000000001,"he may have said something in front of his cellmate, a none-too-bright fellow, now released."
2208,0.9279999999999998,this fellow must have been passing through salisbury and thought he would deliver the message.
2209,0.298,he was always a little bit vindictive.
2210,-0.3330000000000002,"the policeman wrote all this down, delivered a caution, and the two men, finding common ground in their lifelong support for manchester city, parted after a handshake."
2211,0.223,i listened as best i could.

2213,-0.276,"adam listened too, nodding sagely, as if he would not been powered down this past hour and understood everything already."
2214,-0.41,"miranda's mood-tone, to which i was so closely attuned, was lightly tinged with indignation, now directed at the authorities rather than me."
2215,-1.5819999999999996,"not believing anything gorringe had told the detective sergeant, she would been to the weekly surgery of our clapham mp--labour, of course, a tough old bird, union organiser, scourge of the bankers."
2216,0.30299999999999994,she directed miranda back to the police.
2217,0.40800000000000003,her prospective murder was not a constituency matter.
2218,-0.547,"after this account, a silence."
2219,-0.998,i was preoccupied by the obvious question my own deceit prevented me from asking.
2220,0.04600000000000004,what had she done to deserve a death?
2221,-0.577,"adam said, ""does gorringe know this address?"""
2222,1.62,"she responded to these plodding questions as though they came from a real person, an investigating detective, not ""a fucking machine."""
2223,1.8940000000000001,"since adam did not ask, it was clear he already knew what miranda had done,"
2224,-0.46199999999999997,"what monstrous act, to provoke gorringe."
2225,-0.623,none of this was adam's business
2226,-0.797,and i was wondering about his kill switch.
2227,2.419,"i wanted more coffee, but i felt too weary to get up from my chair to make it."
2228,-1.301,then we heard footsteps along the narrow path between the houses that leads to the shared front door.
2229,0.8999999999999999,"too late for the postman, far too soon for gorringe."
2230,0.557,we heard a man's voice giving what sounded like instructions.
2231,0.5810000000000001,then the bell rang and footsteps receded rapidly.
2232,0.0,"i looked at miranda, she looked at me and shrugged."

2236,0.613,"please."""
2237,1.665,he rose immediately and went into the tiny crowded hall where coats hung between the gas and electricity meters.
2238,0.071,we listened as he turned the door latch.
2239,-0.644,seconds later the front door closed.
2240,1.771,"adam came into the room leading by the hand a child, a very small boy."
2241,-0.2539999999999999,he wore dirty shorts and t-shirt and pink plastic sandals a couple of sizes too large.
2242,-0.63,his legs and feet were filthy.
2243,2.094,in his free hand was a brown envelope.
2244,1.352,"he clung to adam's hand, in fact to his forefinger."
2245,0.521,he was looking steadily from miranda to me.
2246,0.981,by this time we were both standing.
2247,-0.014000000000000005,adam prised from the child's fist the envelope and passed it to me.
2248,0.287,it was as soft and limp as suede from much use and had some additions and crossings-out on it in pencil.
2249,1.325,inside was the card i would given to the boy's father.
2250,0.37999999999999995,on the back was a note in thick black upper-case letters.
2251,0.6509999999999998,"i passed it to miranda and looked back at the boy, then i remembered his name."
2252,-0.025999999999999912,"i said in the kindliest way, ""hello, mark."
2253,0.833,"how did you get here?"""
2254,-0.20199999999999996,"by this time miranda, making a soft, sympathetic sound, was going towards him."
2255,0.656,but he was no longer looking in our direction.
2256,-0.396,"instead, he was gazing up at adam, whose finger he still gripped."
2257,0.10099999999999992,"he might have been in shock, but the little boy showed no outward signs of distress."
2258,2.3400000000000003,"he would have been better off crying, for he gave an impression of inner struggle."
2259,-0.39599999999999996,"he stood among strangers in the alien kitchen, shoulders back, chest out, trying to be large and brave."
2260,0.435,"at just over a metre high, he was doing his best."
2261,1.4009999999999998,his sandals suggested an older sister.
2262,0.0,where was she?
2263,1.125,i had told miranda about the encounter in the swing park and she had understood the note.
2264,0.8419999999999999,she tried to put her arms round mark's shoulders but he shrugged her off.
2265,1.028,it was possible he would never been taught the luxury of being comforted.
2266,2.096,adam stood still and upright and the boy kept firm hold of the reassuring finger.
2267,0.019000000000000017,"miranda knelt down in front of him, levelling with him, determined not to condescend."
2268,0.2870000000000001,"adam knew nothing at first hand about children, but everything that could be known was available to him."
2269,3.566,"he waited for miranda, then he said in an unforced tone, ""so, what shall we have for breakfast?"""

2271,0.025,"toast."""
2272,0.9279999999999999,that was a fortunate choice.
2273,1.337,"i crossed the kitchen, relieved to have something to do."
2274,1.85,miranda also wanted to make the toast and we fumbled around together in a small space without touching.
2275,-0.06799999999999998,"i sliced the bread, she brought out the butter and found a plate."
2276,0.0,miranda said.
2277,0.711,"the small voice was immediate, assertive in its way, and we felt reassured."
2278,2.0109999999999997,"miranda poured milk, but into a wine glass, the only clean vessel available."
2279,-1.1,when she presented it to mark he looked away.
2280,0.0470000000000001,i rinsed out a coffee mug
2281,-0.531,he took it in two hands but would not be led to the table.
2282,0.5650000000000002,"watched by us, he stood alone in the centre of the kitchen, eyes closed, and drank, then set the mug down at his feet."
2283,-0.5539999999999999,"i said, ""mark, would you like butter?"
2284,0.0,marmalade?
2285,-0.894,"peanut butter?"""
2286,-1.005,"the boy shook his head, as though each offer was an item of sad news."
2287,-1.2,"he took them off the plate and gripped them in his fist and ate them methodically, letting the crusts fall to his feet."
2288,1.371,it was an interesting face.
2289,0.665,"very pale, plump, unblemished skin, green eyes, a bright rosebud of a mouth."
2290,1.904,"the ginger-blond hair was buzz-cut close to the scalp, which gave his long, delicate ears a prominent look."
2291,0.0,adam said.
2292,-0.469,mark followed me along the narrow corridor and into the lavatory.
2293,-0.8360000000000001,i lifted the seat and helped him pull his shorts down.
2294,0.587,he had no underwear.
2295,2.497,"he was competent with his aim, and his bladder was capacious, for the tiny stream lasted a while."
2296,0.22099999999999997,i tried to make conversation while he tinkled away.
2297,1.2149999999999999,shall we look for a picture book?
2298,0.559,he did not reply.
2299,0.08499999999999994,"it had been a long time since i would seen a penis so minuscule, so dedicated to one uncomplicated task."
2300,0.597,his defencelessness seemed complete.
2301,0.048000000000000126,"when i helped him wash his hands, he appeared familiar with the routine, but he refused the towel and dodged out into the corridor."
2302,1.297,back in the kitchen it looked cheerful.
2303,0.338,"while miranda and adam cleared up, flamenco music was playing on the radio."
2304,1.1059999999999999,"the newcomer had delivered us into the mundane as well as the momentous, into unbuttered toast as well as the shock of a rejected existence."
2305,-2.211,"our own scattered concerns--a betrayal, a disputed claim to consciousness, a death threat--were trivial."
2306,2.216,"with the little boy among us it was important to clean up, impose order, and only then reflect."
2307,1.058,the scintillating guitar soon gave way to shambolic and frenzied orchestral music.
2308,-0.833,i snapped it off and into the momentary bliss of silence that followed
2309,-0.17700000000000005,"adam said, ""one of you should now be in touch with the authorities."""
2310,0.0,she meant no.

2322,-0.9770000000000001,mark had gone to stand by adam's side and held the fabric of his jeans between forefinger and thumb.
2323,1.983,adam lowered his voice for the boy's benefit.
2324,-1.042,"with great force, miranda struck the edge of the tin dustpan against the rim of the pedal dustbin to empty out the sweepings."

2326,-0.12199999999999997,the fucking machine was talking sense.
2327,0.094,miranda was driven by something other than sense.
2328,-0.16399999999999995,"perhaps it was beyond adam to understand her, or to interpret the noise she had made with the dustpan."
2329,1.807,"i listened and watched and dried the glasses and placed them on their shelf in the cupboard, where they had not been in a long time."

2341,-0.75,the inhalation that preceded his wail was also prolonged.
2342,0.571,the tears were instant.
2343,2.518,miranda made a comforting sound and put a hand on the boy's arm.
2344,0.807,it was not the right move.
2345,-0.05899999999999994,the wail rose to a siren shriek.

2347,-1.13,"when adam glanced across at me, i gave a helpless shrug."
2348,-0.5219999999999999,mark surely needed his mother.

2353,0.8649999999999999,he had spoken a whole sentence at last and we were relieved.

2355,-1.121,"more so with the old boundary markers of class--barf and wiv, and glottal t's."
2356,1.331,we would give him everything he wanted.
2357,0.039,but what boat?
2358,0.8639999999999999,a competition was forming for mark's affections.
2359,0.07400000000000015,she stretched out her arms to gather him up but he shrank from her and pressed his face into adam's chest.
2360,-0.11800000000000005,"adam looked rigidly ahead, as she called with face-saving cheeriness, ""let us run the bath,"" and led them out and along the corridor to my unappealing bathroom."

2363,-0.7709999999999999,there were fresh cries of distress from the bathroom.
2364,-0.6000000000000001,"adam hurried back into the kitchen, seized a cereal packet, lifted out its bag, ripped the box apart, flattened it, and in blurred seconds, using some technique he must have copied from a japanese website, fashioned an origami boat, a barque with a single, billowing mainsail."
2365,-1.26,then he hurried out and the wailing subsided.
2366,0.039,the boat was launched.
2367,2.912,"i sat at the table in a stupor, aware that i should get to my screen and earn some money."
2368,-0.6440000000000001,the month's rent was due and there was less than ps40 in the bank.

2381,0.039,but their boat was sunk.
2382,-1.9700000000000002,"mark walked in, barefoot and wearing what looked like an ankle-length gown."

2390,0.423,i gave him no encouragement.

2410,0.564,i was about to ask more when adam glanced up.
2411,-0.57,i turned in my chair.
2412,0.534,miranda was already in the kitchen
2413,0.0,and she had heard what adam said.

2416,2.407,his feet left the ground and he screamed in delight as she spun him round.
2417,0.571,he shouted for more.
2418,1.5339999999999998,"but now she linked arms with him and showed him how to turn about, ceilidh-style, and stamp on the floor."

2420,-0.1459999999999999,his arm did not extend much above his head.

2427,-1.1990000000000003,"he was completely still, and still without expression, looking not so much at the dancers as through them."
2428,1.4409999999999998,"it was his turn to be the cuckold, for he was no longer the boy's best friend."
2429,-0.52,she had stolen him away.

2431,-0.7010000000000001,a courtroom accusation?
2432,0.138,i had to know more.
2433,1.3490000000000002,mark's gaze never left miranda's face.
2434,0.0,he was entranced.

2436,-0.907,"if so, she may have been wrong."
2437,2.122,adam could imitate and respond to emotions and appear to take pleasure in reasoning.
2438,0.6469999999999999,he might also have known something of the purposeless beauty of art.
2439,-0.5569999999999999,"she set mark down, took his hands again in hers, this time with arms crossed."
2440,1.464,"they circled stealthily, with undulating, rippling movements as she chanted, to his delight, ""if you go down in the woods today, you are sure of a big surprise . ."
2441,1.349,"hours later, i discovered that during this kitchen romp adam was in direct contact with the authorities."
2442,-0.8890000000000001,"it was not unreasonable of him, but he did it without telling us."
2443,2.654999999999999,"and so it was that after the dancing and a glass of iced apple juice in the garden, after the clean clothes had been ironed and put on, and the pink sandals scrubbed under the tap, dried and fitted round the tiny feet, whose nails were freshly trimmed, after the lunch of scrambled eggs and a session of nursery rhymes, there came the ring on the doorbell."
2444,1.185,"two asian women in black headscarves--they could have been mother and daughter--apologetic but professionally firm, had come straight from their department to collect mark."
2445,0.16799999999999993,they listened to my story of the swing-park scene and examined the three-word message on a scrap of cardboard.
2446,-0.23099999999999998,they knew the family and asked if they could take the note away.
2447,1.246,"they explained that they would not be returning mark to his mother--not yet, not until after another round of assessments and the decision of a judge."
2448,0.526,their manner was kindly.
2449,-0.995,"the more senior woman, whose name was jasmin, stroked mark's head as she talked."

2452,1.1440000000000001,our visitors were aware of him and exchanged a curious glance.
2453,0.899,we were in no mood to introduce him.
2454,-1.478,"after some administrative formalities, the women nodded at each other and the younger one sighed."

2457,-1.732,"as the social workers were leading him out through the front door, miranda turned away abruptly to go upstairs."
2458,0.794,our troubled little household also shook in the larger tremors of confusion that were running through the land beyond north clapham.
2459,-0.573,turmoil was general.
2460,0.14400000000000002,"mrs. thatcher's unpopularity was rising, and not just because of the sinking."

2465,-0.633,one commentator invoked the gladiatorial combats of the late roman republic.
2466,0.829,the summer was hot and something was coming to the boil.
2467,-3.5919999999999996,"apart from the government's unpopularity, much else was rising: unemployment, inflation, strikes, traffic jams, suicide rates, teenage pregnancies, racist incidents, drug addiction, homelessness, rapes, muggings and depression among children."
2468,5.442,"benign elements were rising too: households with indoor lavatories, central heating, phones and broadband; students at school until eighteen, working-class students at university; attendance at classical music concerts, car and home ownership, holidays abroad, museum and zoo visits, takings at bingo halls, salmon in the thames, numbers of tv channels, numbers of women in parliament, charity donations, native tree plantings, paperback book sales, music lessons across all ages and instruments and styles."

2708,-0.2410000000000001,perhaps some intelligible part of her had been damaged.
2709,-1.3599999999999999,i was anxious to dismiss that.
2710,1.31,"it must be that she knew more about love, the deeper processes of love, than i did."

2712,-0.23500000000000001,"more like a psychological arrangement, or a theorem, a hypothesis, a glorious accident, like light falling on water."
2713,-0.5269999999999998,"was not that of nature, and was not this old hat, men thinking of women as blind forces?"
2714,0.082,"then, might she resemble a counterintuitive euclidean proof?"

2753,-0.21599999999999997,she went one evening to gorringe's bedsit in the centre of town.
2754,0.8560000000000001,"they knew each other from school, which they had left only months before, but they were not close friends."

2767,0.8440000000000001,within a minute there came a reply in the form of a laughing emoticon making the thumbs-up sign.
2768,1.3499999999999999,the case for the defence should have been simple.
2769,0.034,but the messages were not on miranda's phone.

2776,-0.4640000000000001,"the prosecution suggested that it was too convenient, a vanishing rootless teenager."

2783,1.142,mr. gorringe's defence had already had many months to mount their case.
2784,1.049,a court order should have been sought long ago.
2785,3.558,"memorably, the judge noted that a young woman who took a bottle of vodka to a young man's room should have been aware of the risks."
2786,0.6609999999999999,some press reports portrayed gorringe as a guilty sort.
2787,0.031000000000000028,"he was large, loose-limbed, he lounged in the dock, he did not wear a tie."
2788,1.2670000000000001,he appeared not to be awed by the judge or his court and its procedures.
2789,0.954,the jury was unanimous in favouring miranda's story over his.
2790,0.026999999999999982,"later, in his summing-up, the judge did not find the accused a credible witness."
2791,1.555,but certain sections of the press were sceptical about miranda's story.
2792,2.941,the judge was criticised for not putting the matter beyond doubt by calling in her text records.
2793,-0.76,"a week later, before sentencing, there were pleas of mitigation."

2801,-0.29800000000000004,the jury had confronted a stark choice.

2803,1.373,"naturally, i could bear neither."
2804,0.6459999999999999,"i did not take gorringe's murderous threats as proof of his innocence, as the intentions of a wronged man looking for redress."
2805,-1.024,a guilty man could be furious at his loss of freedom.
2806,-1.6,"if he could threaten to kill, he could surely rape."
2807,1.015,beyond the either-or was a dangerous middle ground where the half-forgotten student anthropologist in me could free his imagination of all constraint.
2808,7.546,"grant the insidious power of self-persuasion, mix in some hours of carefree teenage drinking and blurred recall, then it would have been possible for miranda to feel genuinely that she would been violated, especially if afterwards there were elements of shame; equally possible for peter gorringe to convince himself he had permission when he desired it so urgently."
2809,-0.823,"but in the criminal courts, the sword of justice fell on innocence or guilt, not both at once."
2810,0.8699999999999999,"the story of the missing texts was particular, inventive, easily verified or disproved."

2817,-0.098,"either way, it had let itself down."
2818,1.03,his story should have been checked.

2829,0.514,"his eyes were open and had that tranquil, faraway look whenever he retreated into his circuits."

2839,-0.9,what a terrible thing i did.
2840,1.002,i honestly did not intend it.

2842,0.834,it looked as though he was about to embrace me.
2843,2.155,"with my free hand, i pushed past--i disliked the too-solid feel and went to the sink."

2845,0.7549999999999999,"when i turned, he was standing close, no more than three or four feet away."
2846,0.6090000000000001,the moment of apology had passed.
2847,0.8019999999999999,i was determined to look relaxed--not so easy with my arm in a sling.
2848,1.4389999999999992,"i put my free hand on my hip and looked into his eyes, into the nursery blue with its little black seeds."
2849,-0.852,"i still wondered what it meant, that adam could see, and who or what did the seeing."
2850,-0.772,"a torrent of zeros and ones flashed towards various processors that, in turn, directed a cascade of interpretation towards other centres."
2851,1.004,no mechanistic explanation could help.
2852,1.7670000000000003,it could not resolve the essential difference between us.
2853,0.24599999999999994,"i had little idea of what passed along my own optic nerve, or where it went next, or how these pulses became an encompassing self-evident visual reality, or who was doing my seeing for me."
2854,0.0,only me.
2855,1.7280000000000002,"whatever the process was, it had the trick of seeming beyond explanation, of creating and sustaining an illuminated part of the one thing in the world we knew for sure--our own experience."
2856,-0.03200000000000003,it was hard to believe that adam possessed something like that.
2857,1.4089999999999998,"easier to believe that he saw in the way a camera does, or the way a microphone is said to listen."
2858,-0.76,there was no one there.
2859,0.303,"of himbut as i looked into his eyes, i began to feel unhinged, uncertain."
2860,-0.39099999999999996,"despite the clean divide between the living and the inanimate, it remained the case that he and i were bound by the same physical laws."
2861,1.9140000000000001,"perhaps biology gave me no special status at all, and it meant little to say that the figure standing before me was not fully alive."
2862,0.8269999999999997,"in my fatigue, i felt unmoored, drifting into the oceanic blue and black, moving in two directions at once--towards the uncontrollable future we were making for ourselves where we might finally dissolve our biological identities; at the same time, into the ancient past of an infant universe, where the common inheritance, in diminishing order, was rocks, gases, compounds, elements, forces, energy fields--for both of us, the seeding ground of consciousness in whatever form it took."
2863,-0.596,i came out of this reverie with a start.
2864,1.9999999999999996,"i confronted an immediate and unpleasant situation and was not inclined to accept adam as a brother, or even a very distant cousin, however much stardust we shared."
2865,-0.03,i had to stand up to him.
2866,-0.75,i started talking.
2867,0.843,i told him how i came by a large sum of money after my mother's death and the sale of her house.
2868,0.9719999999999999,"how i decided to invest it in a grand experiment, to buy an artificial human, an android, a replicate--i forget which term i used."
2869,1.165,"in his presence, they all sounded like insults."
2870,1.298,i told him exactly how much i paid.
2871,4.716,"then i described for him the afternoon when miranda and i carried him on a stretcher into the house, unpacked him, charged him up, when i tenderly gave him my clothes, and discussed the formation of his personality."
2872,-0.653,"as i went along, i was not certain of my purpose, or why i was talking so fast."
2873,0.616,it was only when i got there that i knew what i had to say.
2874,0.879,"my point was this: i had bought him, he was mine, i had decided to share him with miranda, and it would be our decision, and only ours, to decide when to deactivate him."
2875,1.0179999999999998,"if he resisted, and especially if he caused injury as he had the night before, then he would have to be returned to the manufacturer for readjustment."
2876,0.1050000000000001,"i finished by saying that this was miranda's view, as she expressed it earlier this afternoon, just before we made love."
2877,0.698,"this last intimate detail, for the lowest of reasons, i needed him to know."
2878,-1.4100000000000001,"throughout, he remained impassive, blinking at irregular intervals, holding my gaze."
2879,-0.7690000000000002,"when i finished, nothing changed for half a minute and i began to think i had gone too fast, or spoken gibberish."
2880,1.6189999999999998,"suddenly he came to life (to life!), looked down at his feet, then turned and walked a few paces away."
2881,0.12299999999999993,"he turned again to look at me, drew breath to speak, changed his mind."
2882,-0.15999999999999992,a hand went up to stroke his chin.
2883,0.636,what a performance.
2884,0.578,perfect.
2885,1.3539999999999999,i was ready to give him my devoted attention.
2886,1.161,"his tone was of the sweetest, most reasonable kind."
2887,0.131,"we can talk about it in a civilised manner, as you just have."
2888,2.632,"which convinces me that we have passed the point in our friendship when one of us has the power to suspend the consciousness of the other."""
2889,-0.72,i said nothing.
2890,0.0,he continued.
2891,0.655,i love you both.
2892,1.46,my duty to you is to be clear and frank.
2893,0.797,i mean it when i say how sorry i am
2894,-0.29300000000000015,i broke a bit of you last night.
2895,1.097,i promise it will never happen again.
2896,0.48599999999999993,"but the next time you reach for my kill switch, i am more than happy to remove your arm entirely, at the ball and socket joint."""
2897,0.2729999999999999,"he said this kindly, as though offering help with some difficult task."
2898,-0.04,"i said, ""that would be messy."
2899,-0.13,"and fatal."""
2900,0.0,there are ways of doing it cleanly and safely.
2901,0.856,a practice refined in medieval times.
2902,0.203,galen was the first to describe it.
2903,0.89,"speed is of the essence."""
2904,0.921,he had been speaking through a smile.
2905,0.86,now he began to laugh.
2906,1.022,"so here it was, his first attempt at a joke, and i joined in."
2907,0.6669999999999999,i was in a state of exhaustion and suddenly found it wildly hilarious.
2908,0.139,"as i passed him on my way to the bedroom he said, ""seriously."
2909,-0.32600000000000007,after last night i came to a decision.
2910,-0.717,i have found a way to disable the kill switch.
2911,1.709,"easier for all of us."""
2912,0.714,very sensible.
2913,0.45999999999999996,"i kicked off my shoes, and lay on the bed on my back, softly laughing to myself."
2914,-0.19999999999999993,"then, forgetting about the painkillers, i was asleep in less than two minutes."
2915,0.030999999999999917,the next morning i turned thirty-three.
2916,2.931,"it rained all day and i worked for nine hours, content to be indoors."
2917,2.971,"for the first time in weeks, my profit for the day was in three figures--just."
2918,0.8350000000000001,"at seven i stood up from my desk, stretched, yawned, looked in my drawer for a clean white shirt, then took a bath."
2919,1.976,"i had to hang my arm over the edge to protect the cast from dissolving, but otherwise i was in good shape."
2920,0.6660000000000001,"i lay in the heat and rising steam, singing snatches of beatles songs in the tiled echo, the new old beatles, and occasionally topping up the hot with my healed toe now fit to turn a tap."
2921,0.0,i soaped myself single-handed.
2922,0.269,not easy.
2923,0.0,thirty-three seemed as significant as twenty-one and miranda
2924,0.031,was treating me to dinner.
2925,0.555,we were meeting up in soho.
2926,1.917,the simple prospect of a rendezvous with her raised my spirits.
2927,1.145,the view i had along the length of my body was uplifting in the misty light.
2928,2.2230000000000003,"my penis, capsized above its submerged reef of hair, winked encouragement with a cocky single eye."
2929,0.0,so it should.
2930,0.0,the muscles of my gut and legs looked nicely sculpted.
2931,0.0,heroic even.
2932,0.0,"i wallowed in self-love, happier than i would been in weeks."
2933,1.2570000000000001,i would been trying not to think about adam all day and had almost succeeded.
2934,1.3039999999999998,"he would been in the kitchen for hours, he was there now--""thinking."
2935,0.0,i sang louder.
2936,-0.713,"in my twenties, some of my most cheerful times were spent getting ready to go out."
2937,0.2,it was the anticipation rather than the thing itself.
2938,-0.25299999999999984,"the release from work, the bath, music, clean clothes, white wine, perhaps a pull on a joint."
2939,-0.6579999999999999,"then stepping out into the evening, free and hungry."
2940,0.8800000000000001,the pads of my fingers were well wrinkled by the time i got out.
2941,2.1189999999999998,"an adaptation, i would read, of our sea- and river-loving ancestors to enable them to catch fish."
2942,1.737,"i did not believe it, but i liked the story, the way it lay beyond disproof."
2943,-1.126,"we did not catch fish with our feet, so toes did not need to wrinkle like that."
2944,-0.43,i dressed in a hurry.
2945,0.7869999999999998,in the kitchen i passed adam without a word--he did not look round--and put up my umbrella to walk the few hundred yards down a squalid side-street to where my wreck of a car was parked.
2946,-2.4699999999999998,"this short depressing stroll often brought me to my usual lament, to the song of my unhappy lot."
2947,0.0,but not tonight.
2948,0.9070000000000001,"my car dated from the mid-sixties, a british leyland urbala, the first model to do 1,000 miles on a single charge, it had 380,000 on the clock."
2949,-1.077,"rust was eating it away, especially around the dents in the bodywork."
2950,-0.707,the wing mirrors had snapped or been snapped off.
2951,-1.408,"there was a long white rip in the driver's seat and a piece of the steering wheel, from eleven to three of the clock, was missing."
2952,1.396,"years ago, a girl had been sick on the back seat after a rowdy indian dinner and not even professional steam-cleaning could erase the scent of vindaloo."
2953,1.569,the urbala had only two doors and it was awkward to get an adult into the back seat.
2954,-0.11000000000000007,but there was little to go wrong with these engines and the car ran smooth and fast.
2955,1.2030000000000003,it was an automatic and easy to drive with one hand.
2956,0.976,"i took my usual route, singing all the way, to vauxhall, then downstream with the river on my left, past lambeth palace and the abandoned st. thomas's hospital, where scores or hundreds of the homeless squatted."
2957,-0.7080000000000001,the windscreen wiper on the driver's side worked every ten seconds or so.
2958,-0.845,the wiper on the passenger side thumped out a beat to my pop tunes.
2959,-0.05600000000000005,"i crossed the thames by waterloo bridge--in both directions, best views in town--then slipped down to take the sinuous curves of the old tram tunnel at speed and burst in triumph into holborn--not the shortest route to soho, but my favourite."
2960,0.659,i was hitting some high notes on a new lennon song.
2961,0.671,what was right with me?
2962,1.413,thirty-three today and in love.
2963,0.7480000000000001,"the unaccountable brew of hormone cocktails--endorphins, dopamine, oxytocin and all the rest."
2964,-2.8800000000000003,because or effect or association--we knew next to nothing about our passing moods.
2965,0.16299999999999992,it seemed objectionable that they should have a material base.
2966,-0.7779999999999998,"on this particular evening, i had not touched grass or even had a sip of wine--there was nothing in the house."
2967,0.14500000000000002,yesterday i had been almost thirty-three and in love
2968,-0.76,and i had not felt like this.
2969,1.0549999999999997,ps104 up on the morning would never have such an effect.
2970,0.2229999999999999,"i should have been sobered by yesterday's exchange with adam about his kill switch, by all the matters i had not raised with miranda, by my poor wrist."

2972,0.032,chemical roulette.
2973,1.614,"free will demolished, and here i was, feeling free."
2974,0.562,i parked in soho square.
2975,0.8049999999999999,i knew of a three-metre stretch where the yellow lines had been tarred over in error and the space was legal.
2976,0.579,most cars would not fit.
2977,0.33100000000000007,"our restaurant, a oneroom shoebox with fierce strip lighting, was in greek street, just a few doors along from the famous l'escargot."
2978,-0.03,there were only seven tables.
2979,0.3590000000000001,"in a corner was an open kitchen, a tiny space defined by a brushed-steel counter, where two chefs in white gear cooked in sweaty proximity."
2980,0.669,"there was a plongeur, and one waiter to serve and clear tables."
2981,0.499,"unless you knew the chef, or knew someone who did, you could not book."
2982,0.321,miranda had a friend at one further remove.
2983,0.569,on a quiet night it was enough.
2984,0.537,"she was there before me, already seated, facing the door as i came in."
2985,-1.5610000000000002,in front of her was an untouched glass of sparkling water.
2986,-0.019000000000000017,"beside it, a small parcel done up with green ribbon."
2987,-2.01,"by the table, in an ice bucket on a stand, was a bottle of champagne, its neck bound in a white napkin."
2988,0.22799999999999998,"the waiter, who had just drawn the cork, was walking away."
2989,2.067,"miranda looked especially elegant, even though she would been at seminars all day and had left the house wearing jeans and a t-shirt."
2990,1.2730000000000001,she would have taken with her a bag of clothes and make-up.
2991,-0.812,she wore a black pencil skirt and a tight black jacket with boxy shoulders and silver thread woven through the fabric.
2992,0.0,i would never seen her before with lipstick and mascara.
2993,-0.43399999999999994,"she had made her mouth smaller, in a dark red bow, and dusted away the faint freckles on the bridge of her nose."
2994,0.58,my birthday!
2995,1.1269999999999998,"at the same time, as i entered the bright white light and closed the restaurant's glass door behind me, i felt a sudden elated detachment."
2996,-0.06499999999999995,"i did not, i could not, love her less."
2997,-0.30700000000000005,but i no longer had to feel anxious or desperate about her.
2998,0.761,i remembered my truisms from the day before.
2999,-0.666,"here she was, and whatever she was, i would find out and celebrate her, regardless."
3000,-0.896,"i could love her, so i thought, and remain immune, unharmed."
3001,-0.02000000000000013,all this in a flash as i squeezed between two crowded tables to get to her.
3002,1.7730000000000001,she raised her right hand and in mock formal fashion i bowed and kissed it.
3003,0.008999999999999897,as i sat down she gazed at my sling with evident pity.
3004,1.687,"the waiter--he looked sixteen and serious--came with glasses, and filled them while holding his hand behind his back."
3005,0.8,a professional.
3006,0.029,"as we raised and clinked them across the table, i said, ""to adam not breaking more of my bones."""
3007,0.9460000000000001,"we laughed, and it seemed as though laughter at the other tables followed and rose with ours."
3008,-0.7879999999999999,what a wild place we were in.
3009,0.138,"she did not know how much, how little, i knew."
3010,-1.1340000000000001,"i did not know what to believe about her, whether she was the victim or perpetrator of a crime."
3011,0.508,it did not matter.
3012,0.632,"we were in love and i remained convinced that even if i came to know the worst, it would make no difference."
3013,1.234,love would see us through.
3014,-0.5870000000000001,"it should have been easier, therefore, to broach any of the issues that my cowardice inclined me to suppress."
3015,0.419,"and i was on the edge of doing just that, of saying more about my broken scaphoid, when she took my good hand in hers across the white linen."
3016,-0.87,i was giddy.
3017,1.414,"it was as if she had proposed that we make love in public, now, across the table."
3018,0.053,she did a comic little double-take.
3019,0.102,she pushed it across with a forefinger.
3020,1.317,"while i unwrapped it, our boy waiter refilled the glasses."
3021,-0.33799999999999997,i found a small plain cardboard box.
3022,0.42100000000000004,inside was a z-shaped piece of strip metal with padding on the parallel surfaces.
3023,-0.04,a wrist exerciser.
3024,0.48,i stood and went around the table to kiss her.
3025,0.147,"someone nearby said, ""oi-oi!"""

3034,-1.3599999999999999,"this is madness."""
3035,0.16899999999999998,"our waiter was hovering and heard everything we said next, even though i murmured quickly."
3036,3.1220000000000003,"the boy said, ""have you decided yet, or shall i come back?"" ""stick around."""
3037,1.4849999999999999,we passed a couple of minutes choosing and changing our minds.
3038,0.538,i ordered at random a twelve-year-old haut-medoc.
3039,1.093,it occurred to me that i was the one paying for my birthday
3040,0.575,treat.
3041,0.347,i cancelled the order and asked for a twenty-year-old bottle of the same.
3042,1.314,the waiter left and we paused to consider where we were.
3043,-0.76,"miranda said, ""are you seeing someone else?"""
3044,3.1189999999999998,the question astonished me and for a moment i was stuck for the most reassuring and convincing reply.
3045,1.366,"at the same time, i noticed that the chef, who was also the owner, had come from behind the counter and was making his way between the tables to the door."
3046,-0.15500000000000003,the waiter was following him.
3047,-0.14299999999999988,i glanced over my shoulder and saw through the glass two figures out on the pavement.
3048,-0.39100000000000007,one of them was folding away an umbrella.
3049,0.08299999999999996,i must have looked evasive to miranda.
3050,0.968,"she added, ""just be honest with me."
3051,0.589,"i do not mind."""
3052,1.5439999999999998,she clearly did mind and i gave her my full attention.
3053,1.54,"you are all i care about."""
3054,1.1110000000000002,i felt a draught of cool air on my neck.
3055,0.254,miranda's gaze shifted from me to the door and i felt i could turn again and look.
3056,0.08400000000000007,"the chef was helping two elderly men out of their long raincoats, which he dumped into the arms of the waiter."
3057,-1.2859999999999998,the men were led to their table--set apart and the only one with a lit candle.
3058,1.7800000000000002,the taller man had swept-back silvery hair and wore a brown silk scarf loosely knotted around his neck and some kind of artist's cotton jacket that drooped from his shoulders.
3059,-0.52,a chair was held out for him and before sitting he looked around the room and nodded to himself.
3060,-0.976,no one else in the restaurant seemed interested.
3061,0.9029999999999999,the man's style of bohemian grandeur was not so unusual in soho.
3062,-0.55,but i was excited.

3064,-0.822,"invented loop quantum gravity more or less single-handed."""
3065,-0.8390000000000002,"so we returned to the question of the someone else i was not seeing, and once she appeared satisfied, we went back to adam and discussed how we might overcome his resistance to the kill switch."
3066,-0.0119999999999999,she suggested hiding the charging cables until he was too weak to resist us.
3067,0.61,i reminded her of his instant origami sailboat.
3068,0.96,he would improvise a power cable in minutes.
3069,-0.272,my concentration was poor during this exchange.
3070,2.4120000000000004,"i kept looking at her, hallucinating a glow around her head and shoulders and thinking about the time when we would be alone, travelling the smooth and rising curve to ecstasy."
3071,1.642,"even as i was hobbled by a state of continuous sexual arousal, it excited me to be in the same room as a great man."
3072,1.0810000000000002,"from pre-war meditations on the idea of a universal computing machine, to bletchley in the early years of the war, to morphogenesis, to his glorious patrician present."

3329,0.4149999999999997,"failures of cognition, honesty, kindness, self-awareness; superb depictions of murder, cruelty, greed, stupidity, self-delusion, above all, profound misunderstanding of others."
3330,2.019,"of course, goodness is on show too, and heroism, grace, wisdom, truth."
3331,0.13300000000000012,"out of this rich tangle have come literary traditions, flourishing, like the wild flowers in darwin's famous hedgerow."

3333,0.3989999999999999,"but when the marriage of men and women to machines is complete, this literature will be redundant because we will understand each other too well."

3341,2.486999999999999,"we will look back and marvel at how well the people of long ago depicted their own shortcomings, how they wove brilliant, even optimistic fables out of their conflicts and monstrous inadequacies and mutual incomprehension."""
3342,1.1640000000000001,"adam's utopia masked a nightmare, as utopias generally do, but it was a mere abstraction."
3343,-0.09,miranda's nightmare was real and instantly became mine.
3344,-1.029,"we sat beside each other at the table, flustered and dumb, a rare combination."
3345,0.5110000000000001,it was left to adam to be clear-headed and set out the reassuring facts.
3346,-0.619,nothing maxfield had said on the phone indicated that gorringe was on his way here tonight.
3347,0.30699999999999994,"if he would been out three weeks, murder was clearly not his priority."

3352,-0.629,he knew nothing about her connection with me.
3353,1.093,it was likely that the threat itself was all the punishment he intended.
3354,0.082,"finally, we had a strongman on our side."
3355,-0.762,"if necessary, he could keep gorringe talking while one of us called the police."
3356,1.4660000000000002,time to open the wine!
3357,0.336,adam set three glasses on the table.
3358,1.49,miranda preferred my father's edwardian teak-handled corkscrew to my fancy gadget with a lever.
3359,0.098,the effort seemed to settle her.
3360,0.11699999999999999,the first glass settled me.

3368,0.231,the only other possible topic was gorringe and everything related to him.

3370,2.27,"as i was washing my hands, i found myself thinking about mark and my fleeting sense of privilege in the playground when he put his hand in mine."
3371,0.9000000000000001,i remembered his look of resilient intelligence.
3372,1.2120000000000002,"i thought of him not as a child, but as a person in the context of his entire life."
3373,0.4229999999999999,"his future was in the hands of bureaucrats, however kindly, and the choices they made for him."

3376,-1.101,"finding jasmin, or any social worker willing to talk to her, was impossible."

3387,1.4719999999999998,"i saw what must have been obvious to everyone--her secretiveness; also, her inability to ask for help, her trick of getting it anyway, and of never being held to account."

3411,0.0,she began without preamble.
3412,1.609,suddenly she seemed eager to tell her story.
3413,0.571,she was brought into the classroom and introduced as mariam.
3414,0.843,"she was slender and dark, with beautiful eyes and the blackest hair you would ever seen, tied with a white ribbon."
3415,0.2829999999999999,salisbury was a very white town back then
3416,-0.12800000000000003,so we were all fascinated by this girl from pakistan.
3417,0.7089999999999999,"i could see that standing there, in front of the class, being stared at by everyone, was hard for her."
3418,-0.57,it was as if she was in pain.
3419,5.775,"when our teacher asked who wanted to be mariam's special friend and show her around and help her, i was the first to put up my hand."
3420,0.6739999999999999,the boy sitting with me was moved to another desk
3421,0.042,and she took his place.
3422,0.8139999999999998,"we sat together in class for years to come, in that school and the next."
3423,2.3289999999999997,"at some point during our first day, she put her hand in mine."
3424,-0.18199999999999997,"lots of us girls were always doing that, but this was different."
3425,1.073,her hand was so delicate and smooth
3426,-0.17999999999999994,"and she was so quiet, so tentative."
3427,1.2440000000000002,"i was pretty shy myself, so i was drawn to her quietness and intimacy."
3428,2.8349999999999995,"she was far more timid than me, at least at first, and i think she made me feel for the first time confident and knowing."
3429,0.655,i fell in love with her.
3430,0.0,i introduced her to my friends.
3431,0.29800000000000004,i do not remember any racism.

3434,-1.187,"she was so unusual, exotic even, and i used to worry that someone would steal her from me."
3435,1.198,but she was a very loyal friend.
3436,0.739,we kept hold of each other's hand.

3440,-0.748,one afternoon she brushed out my hair and tied in one of mariam's ribbons.

3445,1.371,"there was a little sister, surayya, whom mariam adored, and two older brothers, farhan and hamid."
3446,1.961,"her father, yasir, worked for the local authority as a water engineer."
3447,0.164,he was very nice to me too.

3452,0.971,i would grown up without religion and i had no interest in it.
3453,-0.62,mariam was transformed as soon as she was through her front door.
3454,0.5089999999999999,she became playful and far more talkative.
3455,0.843,she was her father's favourite.
3456,-0.006000000000000005,she liked to sit on his knee when he came in from work.
3457,0.04799999999999993,i was a tiny bit jealous.
3458,-2.13,"just outside the cathedral close, tall, thin, early victorian, untidy, dark, piles of books."
3459,1.441,my father was always loving but he spent most of his time in his study and did not like to be disturbed.
3460,0.6990000000000001,a local lady came in to cook my tea.
3461,0.63,"so we were on our own, and we liked that."
3462,0.962,"we made a den in an attic room, we had adventures in our overgrown garden."

3467,0.025,i helped her with her written english.
3468,-0.015000000000000013,she was hopeless at spelling.
3469,0.821,"as time passed and we became more self-conscious, we spent hours talking about our families."
3470,-0.642,we had our first periods within a few weeks of each other.

3472,0.5109999999999999,"we also talked about boys, although we did not go near them."
3473,-0.272,"because of her brothers, she was less bothered, more sceptical about boys than i was."
3474,1.3039999999999998,our last summer at school came around.
3475,1.758,we sat our public exams and thought about university.

3478,0.0,miranda stopped.
3479,-0.239,she took a long slow breath.
3480,1.241,"as she resumed, she reached for my hand."
3481,0.385,she was in a very bad state.
3482,-0.473,at first i could not make out what she was saying.
3483,1.458,she wanted to meet me in a local park.
3484,0.076,"when i got to her, she could not speak."
3485,1.19,"we walked around the park, arm in arm, and all i could do was wait."
3486,0.85,at last she told me what had happened the day before.
3487,0.535,her route home from school took her by some playing fields.
3488,-0.04,it was dusk
3489,-1.79,and she was hurrying because her parents did not like her out alone after dark.
3490,0.41100000000000014,she became aware of a figure following her.
3491,-0.6780000000000002,it seemed to be getting closer each time she turned to look.
3492,0.618,she thought of breaking into a run--
3493,0.097,she was fast--
3494,0.289,then decided she was being silly.
3495,0.602,and she had a satchel full of books.
3496,-0.732,the person following her was getting closer.
3497,-0.548,she turned to confront him and was relieved to see it was someone she vaguely knew--peter gorringe.
3498,2.1339999999999995,"he was not exactly popular, but he was known at school as the only boy who had his own place."
3499,1.063,his parents were abroad and had rented a small bedsit for him for a few months rather than trust him to look after the house.
3500,1.73,"before she could speak to him he ran at her, took hold of her wrist and dragged her behind a brick she would where they keep the mowers."
3501,-0.76,she screamed but no one came.
3502,-0.6930000000000001,"he was large, she was very slight."
3503,0.059,he wrestled her to the ground and that was where he raped her.
3504,0.4650000000000001,"even then, as i was trying to take in this horrific news, i thought that one day everything would be all right."
3505,0.07299999999999995,she would get through this.
3506,1.1010000000000002,"everyone loved and respected her, everyone would be outraged."
3507,-0.6800000000000002,her attacker would go to prison.
3508,1.1549999999999998,i would go to whatever university she chose and stay close to her.
3509,0.021000000000000005,"she told me how she got home that night, told her father she had a heavy cold and went straight to bed."
3510,-0.09499999999999986,"it was lucky, the way she saw it, that her mother was out that evening."
3511,0.5439999999999998,she would have known immediately that something was wrong.
3512,0.138,that was when i began to understand that she had not told her parents.
3513,0.973,we started walking round the park again.
3514,0.099,i told her she must tell them.
3515,2.373,she needed all the help and support she could get.
3516,-0.40800000000000003,"if she had not been to the police yet, i would come with her."
3517,0.0,now!
3518,-0.72,she seized my hands and told me that i understood nothing.
3519,-0.382,"her parents were never to know, nor were the police."
3520,-0.398,i said we should go together and tell her doctor.
3521,0.0,"when she heard that, she shouted at me."
3522,-0.321,the doctor would go straight to her mother.
3523,0.739,he was a family friend.
3524,0.032,her uncles would hear about it.
3525,0.8400000000000001,her brothers would do something stupid and get themselves in serious trouble.
3526,-0.486,her family would be humiliated.
3527,0.05600000000000005,her father would be destroyed if he learned what had happened.
3528,1.535,if i was her friend i had to help her in the way she needed to be helped.
3529,1.904,she wanted me to promise to keep her secret.
3530,0.0,i resisted
3531,0.823,but she came back at me.
3532,-0.41,she was furious.
3533,-1.28,she kept telling me that i understood nothing.
3534,-0.667,"the police, the doctor, the school, her family, my father--no one was to know."
3535,-0.67,i was not to confront gorringe.
3536,0.009000000000000008,"if i did, it would all come out."
3537,2.607,"since we did not have one with me, i swore on 'the idea' of the bible to keep mariam's secret, and on the koran too, and on our friendship and on my father's life."
3538,1.658,"i did as she asked, even though i was convinced that her family would have gathered round her and supported her."
3539,-0.652,and i still believe it.
3540,0.0,more than that.
3541,1.289,i know it for a fact.
3542,0.905,they loved her and would never have cast her out or enacted whatever mad idea she had of family honour.
3543,1.605,they would have put their arms round her and protected her.
3544,-0.16300000000000003,her ideas were all wrong.
3545,-0.07,and i was worse
3546,-1.48,we talked of nothing else.
3547,2.157,for a part of that time i tried to change her mind.
3548,0.643,not a chance.
3549,0.912,"she seemed calmer, even more determined, and i began to think that perhaps she was right."
3550,0.634,it was certainly convenient to think so.
3551,-3.8209999999999997,"keep silent, avoid a family trauma, avoid giving evidence to the police, avoid a terrifying court case."
3552,0.4119999999999999,stay calm and think about the future.
3553,0.653,we were on the edge of becoming adults.
3554,0.09,our lives were about to change.
3555,-0.9,this was a catastrophe
3556,1.4009999999999998,but she would survive it with my help.
3557,1.8399999999999999,whenever i saw gorringe at school i stayed clear of him.
3558,0.291,that was getting easier as the term ran down
3559,-0.061999999999999944,and we school-leavers began to disperse forever.
3560,0.7270000000000001,"before i left, mariam begged me not to phone her home."
3561,2.313,"i think she was afraid that if by chance i started speaking to her mother, i would forget my promise and tell her everything."
3562,0.775,"by then, lots of people had mobile phones, but they had not quite reached us."
3563,0.0010000000000000009,so we wrote letters and postcards every day.
3564,0.20399999999999996,i remember being disappointed by hers.
3565,0.08699999999999997,they were not exactly distant so much as dull.
3566,-0.11099999999999999,there was only one subject and she could not write about it.
3567,-0.633,so she wrote about the weather and tv programmes and said nothing about her state of mind.
3568,1.428,as soon as we were home i went round to her house.
3569,-0.06800000000000002,as i approached i saw that the front door was open.
3570,2.198,her older brother hamid was standing by it.
3571,0.015000000000000013,"a couple of neighbours went in, someone came out."
3572,-0.53,i was filled with dread as i went up to him.
3573,-0.829,"he looked ill, very thin, and for a moment he seemed not to recognise me."
3574,0.0,then he told me.
3575,-0.037000000000000005,she had slit her wrists in the bath.
3576,-0.059000000000000025,the funeral had already happened two days before.
3577,1.5379999999999998,i took a couple of steps back from him.
3578,-0.8480000000000003,"i was too numb for grief, but not too numb for guilt."
3579,0.9209999999999999,mariam was dead because i would kept her secret and denied her the help she needed.
3580,0.30000000000000004,i wanted to run away but hamid made me go into the house and speak to his mother.
3581,0.42000000000000004,but the house was small.
3582,0.6829999999999999,there must have been no more than a dozen visitors.
3583,0.897,sana was sitting on a wooden chair with her back to the wall.
3584,-1.252,"there were people around her but no one was talking, and"
3585,-0.16099999999999992,her face--i will never escape that face.
3586,-0.59,"stricken, frozen in pain."
3587,-0.08799999999999991,"as soon as she saw me, she stretched out her arms towards me and i stooped over her"
3588,0.0,and we embraced.
3589,-1.22,her entire body was hot and clammy and trembling.
3590,0.0,i was not crying.
3591,0.0,not yet.
3592,0.8739999999999999,"then, while her arms were around my neck, she asked me in a whisper, she actually asked me to be honest with her."
3593,-0.31999999999999995,"was there something she should know about mariam, was there something, anything i could tell her that would make sense of this?"
3594,0.076,i could not speak
3595,-1.3399999999999999,but i lied with a shake of my head.
3596,-0.57,i was truly scared.
3597,-0.28,i could not even begin to grasp the enormity of my crime.
3598,0.207,now i was adding to it by condemning my lovely surrogate mother to a lifetime of anguish and ignorance.
3599,0.10099999999999998,"i would killed her daughter with my silence, now i was crushing her with it."
3600,-0.574,"i could hear the family crying out, if only we had known!"
3601,0.713,then they would have turned on me.
3602,0.53,rightly.
3603,2.2390000000000003,"there was and is no way round it, i bear responsibility for mariam's death."
3604,-0.61,seventeen years and nine months old.
3605,0.07100000000000006,"i left sana where she sat and hurried out of the house, avoiding the rest of the family."
3606,0.679,i could not face them.
3607,0.058,especially her father.
3608,0.6940000000000001,"and mariam's darling, the little girl, surayya"
3609,0.455,i was so close to.
3610,0.010000000000000009,i walked away from the house
3611,1.536,and i have never been back.
3612,-0.12,"sana wrote to me a few days later, when mariam's brilliant exam results came through."
3613,0.559,i did not reply.
3614,-0.8160000000000001,to be involved with the family in any way would have been to add to my deceit.
3615,-0.503,"how could i be with them and visit the grave, as she was suggesting, when my presence would be a constant lie?"
3616,-0.684,there was no one i dared speak to about her.
3617,0.316,"you are the first person, charlie, i have told this story to."
3618,-0.454,i grieved and fell into a long depression.
3619,-0.262,i delayed my university course.
3620,0.529,"my father sent me to the doctor, who prescribed antidepressants, and i was glad of the cover and pretended to take them."
3621,0.6679999999999999,i think i could have gone under completely that year if it had not been for my one ambition in life--justice.
3622,-0.049000000000000044,by which i mean revenge.
3623,0.713,i am sure you have guessed what they were.
3624,0.29899999999999993,"he was working in a cafe, saving up to go travelling."
3625,1.19,"when at last i felt strong enough, i went in there with a book."
3626,-0.51,i studied him and fed my hatred.
3627,0.887,and i was friendly towards him when he spoke to me.
3628,0.3879999999999999,i let a week go by before i went back.
3629,-0.72,we spoke again--about nothing much.
3630,2.586,i could see he was interested and i waited for him to ask me round to his place.
3631,0.18899999999999995,"first time, i told him i was busy."
3632,-1.112,by the next i could see he was getting really keen
3633,0.865,and i agreed to call on him.
3634,1.281,i could hardly sleep for thinking and planning.
3635,1.76,i would never have imagined that hatred could bring such elation.
3636,1.01,i did not care what happened to me along the way.
3637,-0.147,"i was reckless, ready to pay any price."
3638,1.458,getting him sent down for rape was my sole reason for keeping going.
3639,0.7050000000000001,"ten years, twelve, his entire lifetime would not have been enough."
3640,0.703,it was all i could afford.
3641,0.5409999999999999,i would had two boyfriends by that summer
3642,0.517,and i knew what to do.
3643,-1.11,"that night, i got gorringe drunk and seduced him."
3644,0.17500000000000002,you know the rest.
3645,2.1630000000000003,"whenever revulsion started to get the better of me, i thought of him wrestling mariam to the ground, ignoring her screams and pleas."
3646,1.554,"i thought of my friend lowering herself into the bath, feeling completely alone, dishonoured and without hope and any wish to live."
3647,0.669,but i was so disgusted and numbed by the experience i could not move.
3648,-0.9450000000000001,"and when i managed to get myself off the bed and dressed, i worried that i had drunk too much and would not be convincing in front of the desk sergeant."
3649,1.189,but it worked out well enough in the morning.
3650,1.354,i made a point of not changing my clothes or washing.
3651,-0.04399999999999993,"so, no shortage of evidence in the right places."
3652,1.831,the new genetic test had been introduced across the country by then.
3653,-0.363,the police were not as unfriendly as i would feared from what i would read in the newspapers.
3654,0.266,they were not particularly sympathetic either.
3655,-0.5759999999999998,"they were efficient, and keen to try out their new dna kit."
3656,0.038,they brought him in and got a match.
3657,1.714,"from that time on, his life was hell."
3658,-0.1,seven months later it got worse.
3659,0.0,i became her and spoke through her.
3660,0.867,i was so deep in lies already that my version of that night came easily.
3661,0.10700000000000001,it helped that i could see gorringe across the courtroom.
3662,0.14400000000000002,i let my hatred drive me on.
3663,1.154,i thought he was pathetic when he came up with the story about the texts i was supposed to have sent to a friend called amelia.
3664,1.403,it was easy enough to prove she did not exist.
3665,1.273,not all the press took my side.
3666,-0.951,some court reporters thought i was a malicious liar.
3667,0.751,the judge was very old school.
3668,0.030999999999999972,"in his summing-up he said that i would knowingly put myself at risk, taking alcohol to a young man's rooms."
3669,0.31099999999999994,the jury still brought in a unanimous verdict.
3670,-0.49,"but when it came to sentencing, i was disappointed."
3671,-0.03,six years.
3672,0.154,gorringe was just nineteen.
3673,0.009000000000000077,"with good behaviour, he would be out at the age of twenty-two."
3674,2.0869999999999997,he paid a bargain price for obliterating mariam's existence.
3675,-2.229,"but if i hated him with such ferocity, it was also because i knew that he and i were partners, bound forever, complicit in mariam's lonely death."
3676,0.068,"and now he wants justice."""
3677,-0.3669999999999999,not long after i was thrown out of the legal profession i formed a company with two friends.
3678,3.3970000000000002,"the idea was to buy romantic apartments in rome and paris at local prices, do them up to a high standard, dress them with antique furniture and sell them to wealthy, cultured americans or to agencies that would do the same."
3679,0.953,it was not exactly the quick route to our first million.
3680,0.505,most cultured americans were not rich.
3681,0.709,those who were did not share our tastes.
3682,-0.43400000000000005,"the work was complicated and exhausting, especially in rome, where we had to learn how and whom to bribe among the officials in local government."
3683,-0.07899999999999996,in paris it was the bureaucracy that wore us down.
3684,0.08500000000000002,one weekend i flew to rome to close a deal.
3685,-0.2820000000000001,it was important for this particular client that i stayed in his expensive hotel.
3686,-1.3900000000000001,this one was a well-established place at the top of the spanish steps.
3687,0.618,the client was staying there in a grand suite.
3688,0.6689999999999999,"i came into the city on a friday evening, hot and harassed from my ride on a crowded airport bus."
3689,0.135,"i was dressed in jeans and t-shirt, with a cheap norwegian airline bag hanging from my shoulder."
3690,0.917,i stepped into a beautiful reception area.
3691,1.723,"just by chance, the manager happened to be standing by the check-in desk."
3692,2.268,he was not waiting for me--i was not important enough for that.
3693,0.6910000000000001,i just happened to breeze in
3694,2.004,"and since he was a courteous gentleman, extremely well dressed and correct, he welcomed me warmly in italian to his hotel."
3695,0.0,i only partly understood what he was saying.
3696,-1.767,"his voice was expressionless, with little variation in pitch, and my italian was poor."
3697,-0.804,a receptionist came over and explained that the manager was congenitally deaf
3698,-0.03,"but he spoke nine languages, most of them european."
3699,0.6539999999999999,since childhood he would been adept at lip-reading.
3700,2.489,rut before he could read mine i would have to indicate which language i was speaking.
3701,0.274,otherwise he could not begin to understand me.
3702,0.116,he ran through his list.
3703,0.0,norwegian?
3704,-0.71,i shook my head.
3705,0.0,finnish?
3706,0.11399999999999999,english came fifth.
3707,0.713,he said he could have sworn i was a nordic sort.
3708,0.136,"so our conversation--pleasant, of no real consequence--could begin."
3709,0.5540000000000003,"rut in theory, an entire world was open to us, and one piece of information had unlocked it all."
3710,2.566,"without it, his great gift could not come into play."
3711,2.217,miranda's story was a version of such a key.
3712,2.1020000000000003,"our conversation, in the form of our love, could properly begin."
3713,2.598,"her secretiveness, withdrawals and silence, her diffidence, that air she had of seeming older than her years, her tendency to drift out of reach, even in moments of tenderness, were forms of grieving."
3714,-0.77,it pained me that she had carried her sadness alone.
3715,1.109,i admired the boldness and courage of her revenge.
3716,1.1280000000000001,"it was a dangerous plan, executed with such focus and brilliant disregard for consequences."
3717,0.658,i loved her more.
3718,0.923,i loved her poor friend.
3719,0.507,i would do everything to protect miranda from this beast gorringe.
3720,0.573,"it touched me, to be the first to know her story."
3721,0.6149999999999999,telling it was a liberation for miranda too.
3722,0.08300000000000009,"half an hour after she had finished, when we were alone in the bedroom, she looped her arms around my neck, drew me to her and kissed me."

3725,-1.91,"it was true, the old cliche about stress and desire."
3726,-2.669,"we undressed each other impatiently and, as usual, my plaster cast made me clumsy."

3728,-0.694,her father still did not know what had happened.

3730,-0.9219999999999999,"the visits to the mosque had at first brought mariam closer, then they seemed futile."
3731,0.123,she wished gorringe had got a longer sentence.
3732,0.27,she remained tormented by her schoolgirlish vow of silence.
3733,2.857,"a simple message, to sana or yasir or to a teacher, would have saved mariam's life."

3748,-0.59,had she visited the grave?
3749,-0.856,"many times, always approaching with caution in case one of the family was there."
3750,0.67,she always left flowers.
3751,1.2640000000000002,in a long conversation it can be difficult to trace how or when the subject comes to shift.
3752,1.564,"it may have been mention of surayya, the love of mariam's life."
3753,0.17900000000000005,that little girl must have led us to mark.
3754,-0.78,miranda said she missed him.
3755,0.569,i said i often thought about him.
3756,-1.51,we had failed to find out where he was and what had happened.
3757,0.35,"he had disappeared into the system, into a cloud of privacy regulation and the unreachable sanctuary of family law."
3758,2.138,"we talked about luck, the hold it had over a child's life--what he is born into, whether he is loved and how intelligently."
3759,0.35500000000000004,"after a pause, miranda said, ""and when it is all against him, whether someone can rescue him."""
3760,2.25,i asked her if she thought her father's love came near to making up for her absent mother.
3761,0.559,she did not reply.
3762,1.196,her breathing was suddenly rhythmic.
3763,0.1140000000000001,"in just a few seconds, she had fallen asleep and was curled against me."
3764,1.836,"gently, i rolled onto my back, staying as close to her as i could."
3765,0.512,"in the half-light, the ceiling looked charmingly ancient rather than stained and disintegrating."
3766,-0.22199999999999986,i followed the jagged line of a crack that ran from a corner of the room towards the centre.
3767,1.138,"if adam had been driven by cogs and flywheels, i would have heard them turning in the silence that had followed miranda's story."

3775,0.0,"precedents retrieved, then compared, rejected or stored?"
3776,2.526,"without self-awareness, it would not be thinking at all so much as data processing."
3777,0.655,but adam had told me he was in love.
3778,0.056,he had haikus to prove it.
3779,1.605,"love was not possible without a self, and nor was thinking."
3780,-0.982,i still had not settled this basic question.
3781,-0.23199999999999993,perhaps it was beyond reach.
3782,-0.622,no one would know what it was we had created.
3783,3.092,whatever subjective life adam and his kind possessed could not be ours to verify.
3784,-1.181,in which case he was what was fashionably referred to as a black box--from the outside it seemed to work.
3785,0.563,that was as far as we would ever get.

4240,2.8209999999999997,i learned that p stood for polynomial time and n stood for non-deterministic.

4291,-0.03799999999999998,he shook her hand and they sat facing each other across the kitchen table while miranda and i hovered.

4301,0.108,we waited in silence.
4302,-1.028,this was like a doctor's bedside visit and we were nervous.
4303,0.845,"occasionally sally said ""uh-uh"" or ""mm"" to herself as she typed in an instruction and got up a fresh page of code."
4304,0.0,adam sat with the faintest of smiles.
4305,0.123,we marvelled that the foundations of his being could be displayed in digits.
4306,1.802,"finally, in the quiet tone of one used to unthinking obedience, sally said to him, ""i want you to think of something pleasurable."""
4307,1.494,he turned his gaze to miranda and she looked right back at him.
4308,0.5900000000000001,on screen the display raced like a stopwatch.

4314,1.516,"that would not have impressed us on our ancient personal computers, but in a facsimile human it did."
4315,0.767,"at other times, sally stared in silence at the display."

4370,1.035,"during the day, my bedroom, my usual refuge, was his."
4371,1.491,"the curve on his graph stiffened, while i began to take in my new situation."
4372,0.10800000000000003,miranda was firmly against moving the computer onto the kitchen table.
4373,0.588,"too intrusive, she argued, in our communal space."
4374,0.5790000000000001,i saw her point.

4378,0.577,i was delighted by the money

4380,-0.04,i was restless.
4381,-0.013999999999999901,"travelling in luxury with miranda through southern europe would have suited me, but she was tied to london and her course."

4383,-0.8460000000000001,"the threat from gorringe, increasingly unlikely, still had the power to constrict our ambitions."
4384,1.5739999999999998,house-hunting might have filled my time
4385,0.553,but i had already found the place.
4386,-0.22500000000000014,"it was a wedding cake on elgin crescent, coated in an icing of pink and white stucco."
4387,1.211,"inside, wide oak floorboards, vast muscular kitchen humming with brushed-steel gear, a conservatory in belle-epoque wrought iron, a japanese garden of smooth river stones, bedrooms thirty feet across, a marbled shower where you could stroll under differently angled torrents."
4388,0.12099999999999994,"the owner, a bass guitarist with a ponytail, was in no hurry."
4389,-0.31299999999999994,"he was in an almost-famous band, and he had a divorce looming."
4390,0.851,he showed me round himself and barely spoke.
4391,-1.494,he handed me into each room and waited outside while i looked.
4392,0.674,"his condition of sale was cash only, ps50 notes, 2,600 of them."
4393,0.131,fine by me.
4394,-0.41800000000000015,"this was my only employment, going to the bank to collect another forty notes--ps2,000 was the maximum daily withdrawal allowed."
4395,1.755,"for no good reason, i did not use a safety deposit box at the bank."
4396,-0.06,i vaguely assumed i was doing something illegal.
4397,0.7839999999999999,certainly the vendor was if he was hiding funds from his ex-wife.
4398,0.104,i stuffed the cash into a suitcase which i stowed under my bed.
4399,-0.06799999999999995,otherwise i was free to be at a loss.
4400,0.413,"it was that time of year, september, when everyone was starting at something fresh."
4401,0.538,miranda was planning her thesis.
4402,0.5289999999999999,i walked on the common and wondered about resuming my education and getting a qualification.
4403,2.174,time to take the proper measure of my intellectual reach and study for a degree in maths.
4404,0.673,"or, the other route, dust off my father's priceless saxophone, learn bebop's harmonic arcana, join a group, indulge a wilder life."
4405,-0.43199999999999994,i did not know whether to be more qualified or wilder.
4406,0.0,you could not be both.
4407,0.057,these ambitions wearied me.
4408,0.819,i wanted to lie down on the worn-out grass of late summer and close my eyes.

4414,0.0,but i did.
4415,-0.26,i felt useless.
4416,1.351,"if i really had stretched out on that tired grass and closed my eyes, i might have seen miranda walking towards me in her new underwear, as she had from the bathroom the night before."
4417,2.4699999999999998,"i would have lingered on that beautiful expectant halfsmile, that steady look as she came close and rested her bare arms on my shoulders and teased me with a light kiss."
4418,2.258,"forget maths or music, all i wanted was to make love to her."
4419,2.072,what i was really doing all day was waiting for her return.
4420,0.7250000000000001,"if we were busy or she was tired and we did not make love in the evening or early morning, my concentration would be even weaker the next day, my future a burden that made my limbs ache."
4421,0.23499999999999996,"i went about in a dim state of semi-arousal, a chronic mental dusk."
4422,0.353,i could not take myself seriously in any domain that did not include her.
4423,1.3319999999999999,"our new phase was brilliant, stunning; everything else was dull."
4424,1.1309999999999998,we loved each other--that was my only coherent thought during a long afternoon.
4425,0.529,"there was sex, then there was talk, on into the early hours."
4426,1.452,"i knew everything now: the day of her mother's death, which she remembered clearly, her father, whose kindness and distance combined to inflame her love for him, and always mariam."
4427,1.151,"in the months after her death, miranda had gone to a mosque in winchester--she did not dare meet the family at prayer in salisbury."
4428,0.9179999999999999,"after she resumed the visits in london, her lack of belief began to get in the way."
4429,-1.29,she felt fraudulent and stopped going.
4430,1.616,"we talked parents, as serious young lovers do, to explain who we were and why, and what we cherished and what we were in flight from."
4431,1.7249999999999996,"my mother, jenny friend, community nurse for a large semi-rural area, had seemed during my childhood in a state of constant exhaustion."
4432,-0.36,later i understood that my father's absences and affairs wore her down more than her job.
4433,0.04499999999999993,"they never liked each other much, though they did not fight in my presence."
4434,0.0,but they were terse.
4435,0.148,"mealtimes were subdued, sometimes taken in rigid silence."
4436,0.0,conversations tended to be routed through me.
4437,0.06900000000000006,"my mother might say to me in the kitchen, ""go and ask your father if he is out tonight."""

4441,-0.214,"then the young, the cool, turned away as pop and rock swept in."
4442,-0.586,"bebop was squeezed into a niche, somewhat churchy, the preserve of frowning men with long, querulous memories."
4443,0.91,my father's income shrank and his infidelities and drinking increased.
4444,-0.268,"when she heard all this, miranda said, ""they did not love each other."
4445,0.655,"but did they love you?"""
4446,0.118,she came with me on the second visit to elgin crescent.
4447,0.8270000000000002,the bass guitarist had a lined face whose sadness was accentuated by a drooping moustache and large brown eyes.
4448,4.396,"i saw us through those eyes, a hopeful, young married couple, seriously rich, about to repeat all his own mistakes."
4449,-0.13200000000000006,"miranda approved, but she was not as excited as i was."
4450,-0.123,she knew about growing up in a large town house.

4452,0.727,"on the way home she said, ""no sign of a woman's presence."""

4459,0.053,no meal was ever cooked in that kitchen.
4460,0.629,only gin and chocolate in the fridge.
4461,0.697,the stone garden needed colour.
4462,-1.161,"as she was telling me this, we were walking south along kensington church street."
4463,0.2919999999999999,i was feeling sorry for the vendor.
4464,1.435,"it was not exactly pink floyd he played for, but it was a band with stadium aspirations."
4465,-0.8380000000000001,"i had treated him briskly, in a pretend businesslike way, protecting myself and my ignorance of house-buying, assuming all power and status were his."
4466,-0.039999999999999925,now i saw that he too might be lost.
4467,1.3529999999999998,"i thought about him the next day, even considered getting in touch."
4468,-0.34099999999999997,this face of sorrow haunted me.
4469,0.674,"i could not escape the memory of the mournful moustache, the elastic band holding the ponytail together, the web of lines from the corners of his eyes, diverging fissures that reached round to his temples, almost to his ears."
4470,0.024,too much dope-induced smiling in the early years.
4471,0.5680000000000001,now i could only see the house through miranda's eyes.

4479,4.024,"through my childhood to my mid-teens, i never saw a play, opera or musical, or heard a live concert, apart from a couple of my father's, or visited a museum or art gallery or took a journey for the sake of it."
4480,0.093,no bedtime stories.

4485,2.507,"so, when good fortune offered the dreamlike opportunity, delivering me from my labours, such as they were, and stuffing me with gold, i was paralysed, inert."
4486,1.162,i would wanted to be rich but never asked myself why.
4487,0.6030000000000001,i had no ambitions beyond the erotic and an expensive house across the river.

4863,0.606,i walked to the local doctor's surgery to have my cast removed.
4864,0.753,i took with me to read again maxfield blacke's magazine profile.
4865,0.29399999999999993,"he was said to be a man ""once rich in thought."

4868,-1.016,"he wrote a novel largely ignored in the anglophone world, but it was a success in the nordic countries."
4869,1.1609999999999998,he edited the book pages of a sunday paper for five years.
4870,1.2049999999999998,"again, his contributors looked back with respect."
4871,0.142,"he spent years on his translation of balzac's la comedie humaine, published in boxed sets."
4872,0.238,it was indifferently received.
4873,1.83,then came a five-act verse drama in homage to racine's andromaque--a poor choice for the times.
4874,-1.563,he wrote two gershwin-like symphonies in named keys when tonality was in general disgrace.
4875,-0.517,"he said of himself that he was spread so thinly, his reputation was only ""one cell thick."
4876,0.7090000000000002,"thinning it further, he devoted three years to a difficult sonnet sequence about his father's experiences in the first world war."
4877,-0.06,"he was a ""not bad"" jazz pianist."
4878,0.849,his rock climbers' guide to the jura was well regarded but the maps were poor--not his fault--and it was soon superseded.
4879,-0.827,"he lived on the edge of debt, in over his head sometimes, though never for long."
4880,-0.85,his weekly wine column probably launched his career as an invalid.
4881,-2.862,"when his body turned against itself, his first affliction was itp, immune thrombocytopenic purpura."
4882,0.962,"he was a great talker, people said."
4883,-0.648,then black spots appeared on his tongue.
4884,3.195,"despite them, he climbed, with help from young associates, the north face of ben nevis--fair achievement for a man in his late fifties, especially when he wrote about it so well."
4885,-0.562,"but the derisive ""almost man"" label appeared to have stuck."

4890,-1.071,"out of politeness, i got in and rode an expensive 300 yards home."
4891,0.058,"that evening, i asked miranda if her father knew about adam."
4892,0.52,"she had told him, she said, but he was not much interested."
4893,-0.45499999999999996,so why was she so keen to take adam to salisbury?
4894,0.8210000000000001,"because, she explained as we lay in bed, she wanted to see what happened between them."
4895,1.95,she thought her father needed a full-on encounter with the twentieth century.

4900,1.6550000000000002,we left the house after breakfast on a blustery wednesday morning.
4901,0.8160000000000001,my car had no rear doors.
4902,0.41999999999999993,it surprised me that adam was so inept as he squeezed himself onto the back seat.
4903,0.7,the collar of his suit jacket became snared on a chrome plate that housed a seat-belt reel.
4904,0.9119999999999999,"when i unhooked him, he seemed to think his dignity was compromised."
4905,-2.4770000000000003,"as we began the long crawl through wandsworth he was moody, our reluctant backseat teenage son on a family outing."
4906,5.908999999999999,"in the circumstances, miranda was cheerful as she filled me in on her father's news: in and out of hospital for more tests; one health visitor replaced by another, at his insistence; his gout returning to his right thumb but not the left; his regrets for the stamina he lacked for all he wanted to write; his excitement at the novella he would soon finish."
4907,0.179,he wished he would discovered the form long before.
4908,0.19899999999999995,the new york apartment idea had been forgotten.
4909,-0.9490000000000001,he had plans for a trilogy after this one.

4915,2.376,"as soon as the money was in place for the notting hill house, i intended to buy myself a high-powered autonomous vehicle."
4916,2.76,miranda and i would drink wine on long journeys and watch movies and make love on the fold-down back seat.
4917,-0.9720000000000001,"by the time i had allusively set out this scheme for her, we were passing the autumnal hedgerows of hampshire."

4919,1.417,"we had decided to make a detour past stonehenge, though i hoped it would not prompt adam to lecture us on its origins."
4920,0.05399999999999994,but he was in no mood for talk.

4922,1.1720000000000002,i began to wonder if he was ready to change his mind about calling on gorringe.
4923,0.0,i would not object.
4924,-0.4320000000000001,"if we did go, he might not, in his moody condition, be active enough in our defence."
4925,0.675,i glanced at him in the rear-view mirror.
4926,0.5140000000000001,his head was turned to his left to watch the fields and clouds.
4927,1.722,i thought i saw his lips moving
4928,0.0,but i could not be sure.
4929,-0.801,when i glanced again his lips were still.
4930,0.0,"in fact, it troubled me when we passed stonehenge without a commentary."
4931,-0.041000000000000286,he was silent too after we crossed the plain and caught our first view of the cathedral spire.
4932,0.061,miranda and i exchanged a look.
4933,-0.5060000000000002,but we forgot about him for a tetchy twenty minutes as we tried to find her house in salisbury's one-way system.
4934,-1.237,this was her home town and she would not tolerate the satnav.
4935,-0.007000000000000006,but her mental map of the city was a pedestrian's and all her instructions were wrong.
4936,-0.471,"after some sweaty you-turns in disobliging traffic and reversing up a one-way street, narrowly avoiding a quarrel, we parked a couple of hundred yards from her family home."
4937,0.9079999999999999,the downturn in our mood appeared to refresh adam.
4938,0.10600000000000001,"as soon as we were on the pavement, he insisted on taking the heavy canvas bag from me."
4939,3.6649999999999996,"we were close to the cathedral, not quite within the precinct, but the house was imposing enough to have been the perk of some grand ecclesiastical."
4940,1.265,adam was the first with a bright hello when the housekeeper opened the door.
4941,0.9670000000000001,"she was a pleasant, competent-looking woman in her forties."
4942,0.003999999999999969,it was hard to believe that she could not cook.
4943,0.03400000000000001,she led us into the kitchen.
4944,0.489,"adam lifted the bag onto a deal table, then he looked around and banged his hands together and said, ""weill marvellous."
4945,0.906,the housekeeper led us up to the first floor to maxfield's study.
4946,0.184,the room was as large as anything in elgin crescent.

4948,0.0,then his features relaxed.
4949,-0.09599999999999997,a good one.

4956,-0.4729999999999999,"she was on one knee, with her arms around his neck."
4957,0.025,the housekeeper had disappeared.
4958,-0.5429999999999999,"it felt uncomfortable to be watching, so i shifted my gaze to the pen."
4959,-0.07400000000000007,"it lay, nib exposed, next to many sheets of unlined paper spread across the desk and covered by tiny handwriting."
4960,0.30699999999999994,"from where i stood, i could see that there were no crossings-out, or arrows or bubbles or additions down the perfectly formed margins."
4961,1.365,"i also had time to observe that apart from the desk lamps, there were no other devices in the room, not even a telephone or a typewriter."
4962,-0.20399999999999996,only the book titles perhaps and the author's chair declared that it was not 1890.

4964,0.0,miranda made the introductions.
4965,-0.5269999999999999,"adam, still in his strange, genial mode, went first."
4966,0.656,then it was my turn to approach and shake his hand.
4967,0.769,"maxfield said unsmilingly, ""i have heard a lot about you from miranda."
4968,-0.129,i am looking forward to a chat.
4969,0.0,"as i spoke, he grimaced."
4970,0.4019999999999999,i appeared to have fulfilled some negative expectation.
4971,0.6649999999999999,"he looked far older than his photograph in the profile, published five years before."
4972,-1.541,"it was a narrow face, whose skin was thinly stretched, as though from too much snarling or angry staring."
4973,-0.23300000000000004,miranda had told me that among his generation there was a certain style of irascible scepticism.
4974,0.379,"you had to ride it out, she told me, because beneath it was playfulness."
4975,3.1799999999999997,"what they wanted, she said, was for you to push back, and be clever about it."
4976,2.755,"now, as maxfield released my hand, i thought i might be capable of pushing back."
4977,0.694,as for being clever--i froze.
4978,0.025,"the housekeeper, christine, came in with a tray of sherry."
4979,0.571,"adam said, ""not for now, thanks."""
4980,0.32700000000000007,he helped christine fetch three wooden chairs from the corners of the room and set them out in a shallow curve facing the desk.
4981,-0.03,"when we three were holding our drinks, maxfield said to miranda, gesturing towards me, ""does he like sherry?"""
4982,1.376,"she in turn looked at me and i said, ""well enough, thanks."
4983,3.307,in fact i did not like it at all and wondered whether it would have been clever in miranda's sense to have said so.
4984,2.442,"she set about asking her father a set of routine questions about his various pains, his medication, the hospital food, an elusive specialist, a new sleeping pill."
4985,0.583,"it was hypnotic, listening to her, the sweetly dutiful daughter."
4986,1.1400000000000001,her voice was sensible and loving.
4987,2.922,she reached over and brushed back fine strands of hair where they floated across his forehead.
4988,0.136,he answered her like an obedient schoolboy.
4989,-1.851,"when one of her questions prompted a memory of some frustration or medical incompetence and he became restive, she soothed him and stroked his arm."
4990,-1.0739999999999998,this invalid catechism soothed me too; my love for miranda swelled.
4991,-0.07599999999999996,"it had been a long drive, the thick sweet sherry was a balm."
4992,0.254,perhaps i liked it after all.

4994,1.656,i did so just in time to hear maxfield blacke's question.
4995,-1.3599999999999999,he was no longer the querulous valetudinarian.

5284,0.22099999999999997,i would go with her to the special playgroup and meet mark and take him out for treats.
5285,0.139,then decide.
5286,0.061,miranda gave me a look--
5287,0.416,pity and humour were in it-- that suggested i was deluded to believe i had a choice.
5288,-0.659,that look more or less did it.
5289,-0.039999999999999925,living alone in the wedding-cake house was unthinkable.

5387,0.6970000000000001,there was no sign of life here or anywhere else in the close.
5388,0.638,i was gripping the steering wheel tightly in one hand.
5389,0.188,i had no choice.

5392,0.108,"on the second ring of the ""oranges and lemons"" door chimes, we heard footsteps on the stairs."
5393,1.417,i was now standing close by miranda's side.

5395,-0.04999999999999985,"at the sound of a hand on the latch, she took a half-pace closer to the door."
5396,1.077,my hand hovered near her elbow.
5397,-0.7569999999999999,"as the door opened, i feared she was about to leap forward in some wild physical assault."
5398,-0.09300000000000008,"the wrong man, was my first thought."

5405,1.531,"we followed her in and entered a long room, with thick orange carpeting and milky white leather sofas and armchairs arranged around a two-metre block of polished wood on which stood an empty vase."
5406,1.843,gorringe sat and waited for us to do the same.
5407,-0.52,miranda sat opposite him.

5413,0.138,"she said, ""you know why i am here."""
5414,1.083,"i saw now that there was a scar, three or four inches long, a vermilion sickle shape on his neck."
5415,0.571,he was waiting for her.
5416,-0.09800000000000006,he leaned back in his chair and placed his big white hands on his lap.

5438,0.057,"these were not questions, they were taunts, insults."

5474,0.20699999999999996,"but out of her humiliation afterwards, perhaps i will not have to go on thinking that the friend i loved died for nothing."
5475,-0.76,"and one more--"""
5476,-0.33899999999999997,"in a loping movement, gorringe was out of his chair at speed and bending towards miranda with his arm swinging in a wide arc towards her face."
5477,1.615,i had time to see that his hand was open.
5478,-3.209,"it was going to be a slap, an extremely hard one, far more violent than the sort men in movies once gave to women to bring them to their senses."
5479,0.23500000000000001,i had barely begun to lift my own hand in her defence when adam's rose to intercept and close around gorringe's wrist.
5480,-0.017,the deflected sweep of his fastmoving arm provided the momentum that smoothly swung adam to his feet.
5481,0.7030000000000001,"gorringe dropped to his knees, just as i had, with his captured hand twisted above his head and about to be crushed, while adam stood over him."
5482,-0.81,it was a tableau of agony.
5483,-0.52,miranda looked away.
5484,0.741,"still maintaining the pressure, adam forced the young man back to his chair and, as soon as he was seated, released him."
5485,0.04399999999999991,so we sat in silence for several minutes as gorringe nursed his arm against his chest.
5486,-0.57,i knew that pain.
5487,-0.74,"as i remembered, i had made more fuss."
5488,0.136,he had appearances to keep up.
5489,0.692,prison culture must have toughened him.

5491,-1.08,"gorringe murmured, ""i am going to be sick."""
5492,0.136,"but he did not move, and nor did we."
5493,1.16,we were waiting for him to recover.

5495,-0.0010000000000000703,"this was what she had come here for, to see him, to really see him."
5496,0.0,but now what?
5497,0.778,she surely doubted there was anything meaningful that gorringe could tell her.
5498,0.52,he suffered the failure of imagination that afflicted and enabled all rapists.
5499,-0.26699999999999996,"when his weight was on mariam, when she was pinned to the grass, when she was in his arms, he failed to imagine her fear."
5500,0.53,even as he saw and heard and smelled it.
5501,0.121,the lifting curve of his arousal was not troubled by the idea of her terror.
5502,1.8829999999999998,"at that moment, she may as well have been a sex doll, a device, a machine."
5503,-1.35,or--i had gorringe completely wrong.
5504,1.647,i had the mirror image of the truth.
5505,0.586,i was the one with the failed imagination: gorringe knew the state of mind of his victim all too well.
5506,1.023,"he entered her misery and thrilled to it, and it was precisely this triumph of imagining, of frenzied empathy, that drove his excitement into an exalted form of sexual hatred."
5507,0.162,i did not know which was worse or whether there was some sense in which both could be true.
5508,0.10899999999999999,they seemed mutually exclusive to me.
5509,0.23,but i was certain that gorringe did not know either and that he would have nothing to tell miranda.
5510,-0.674,"as the sun through the plate glass at our backs sank a little lower, the room was filling with light."
5511,1.0779999999999998,the three of us sitting in a row on the sofa would have appeared as silhouettes to gorringe.
5512,2.967,"to us he was illuminated like a figure on a stage and it seemed appropriate when he, not miranda, started to speak."
5513,2.181,he pressed his right hand against his chest with his left as though taking a vow of honesty.
5514,0.575,he had dropped the thuggish tone.
5515,-0.17900000000000005,"pain at this level was a tranquilliser, an enforcer, stripping the affectation out, coaxing his voice back to that of the undergraduate he might have become without miranda's intervention."
5516,-0.009000000000000008,he was in for armed robbery.
5517,2.145,the prison was shortstaffed so we were often locked up together for twenty-three hours a day.
5518,-0.28800000000000003,this was right at the beginning of my term.
5519,2.008,"the worst time, everyone says, the first few months, when you do not accept where you are"

5522,-1.1300000000000001,i hey told me i had anger problems
5523,0.671,and they were right.
5524,-0.10500000000000004,i thought because i was six two and played rugby in the second row i could look after myself.
5525,-0.29,that was crap.
5526,-0.72,i knew nothing about real fighting.
5527,1.518,i got my throat slashed and could have died.

5529,-0.12,he was a vicious little runt.
5530,-1.274,"but somehow, in his case, i kept control of myself and he delivered my message once he was out."

5960,1.619,"he should have known that, many said, when he made his pledgealso, the tax itself was not about to be repealed because there were so many other more important bills going through parliament."
5961,0.341,there was also anger on his right.

6036,0.19200000000000006,pulled his shirt clear and shoved the socket into his stomach and fell onto one of the hard kitchen chairs with a moan of relief.

6065,2.999,"whenever a good friend of mine brought his autistic brother round, the dog growled at him and had to be locked away."
6066,0.8160000000000001,a consciousness unconsciously understood.
6067,0.8620000000000001,"but mark's expression suggested awe, not aggression."

6076,0.043,adam's voice deepened.
6077,-0.2260000000000002,mark shook his head emphatically so that his entire body twisted from left to right and back.
6078,0.0,it hardly mattered.
6079,1.561,the question was merely a friendly gesture and adam was retreating into his version of sleep.
6080,1.276,"he had described it to me variously; he did not dream, he ""wandered."""
6081,0.69,"he sorted and rearranged his files, reclassified memories from short to long term, played out internal conflicts in disguised form, usually without resolving them, reanimated old material in order to refresh it, and moved, so he put it once, in a trance through the garden of his thoughts."
6082,0.44400000000000006,"in such a state he conducted in relative slow motion his researches, formulated tentative decisions, and even wrote new haikus or discarded or reimagined old ones."
6083,2.342,"he also practised what he called the art of feeling, allowing himself the luxury of the entire spectrum from grief to joy, so that all emotion remained accessible to him when fully charged."
6084,1.7129999999999999,"it was, above all else, he insisted, a process of repair and consolidation from which he emerged daily, delighted to find himself to be, once again, self-aware, in a state of grace--his word and to reclaim the consciousness that the very nature of matter permitted."
6085,0.02100000000000002,we watched as he sank away from us.
6086,0.10500000000000005,"at last mark whispered, ""he is asleep and his eyes are open."""

6096,1.583,"i picked up some magazines from the floor and put them on the shelves, clipped together some invoices and tidied the papers on my desk."
6097,0.49,"at last i sat down at the screen to think about earning a little money myself, in the old style."

6117,1.6239999999999999,"it was as though i was waiting for the next event, the decent one that would undo the event before."
6118,-1.026,"then i began to wonder whether this was the beginning of a history marker, of a general unravelling, or one of those isolated outrages that fade in time, like kennedy's near-death in dallas."

6123,0.043,i watched them from the doorway.
6124,0.46900000000000003,he shifted position to kneel up and curl an arm around her neck.
6125,0.516,she gave him a piece and pointed to where it belonged.
6126,0.052999999999999936,"with much fumbling, much help, he slotted it in."

6133,2.4159999999999995,it took time for him to get it in position.
6134,0.36299999999999993,"he had it upside down, then his hand slipped and displaced some adjacent bits of sky."
6135,0.8580000000000001,"at last, with miranda guiding him, her hand on top of his, the fragmurment was in place."
6136,1.464,he glanced up at me and smiled confidingly about a triumph he seemed to want to share.
6137,1.561,"that look and the smile, which i returned, dispelled all my private doubts and i knew i was committed."
6138,4.061,"when adam emerged from his recharge he was in an odd state, well removed from wonder at the fact of conscious life."
6139,-1.311,"he moved slowly about the kitchen, stopping to look around, grimacing, moving on and making a humming sound, a high to low glissando, like a moan of disappointment."

6141,2.4410000000000003,"he spent half an hour morosely sweeping up the pieces, then sweeping again, then looking for shards of glass on hands and knees."

6160,0.119,mrs. thatcher's office had released a statement.

6162,0.486,we decided it was.

6174,0.722,the route to adoption was difficult and long and miranda had learned that we were almost two-thirds of the way.

6529,0.738,"i was in the public gallery, sitting across from mariam's family."
6530,0.04100000000000001,"i could hardly bear to look their way, their radiating misery was so intense."
6531,0.772,"when the judge handed down gorringe's eight-year sentence, i forced myself to look across at mariam's mother."
6532,1.0030000000000001,"she was openly crying, whether from relief or sorrow i would never know."
6533,1.472,miranda's case came round all too soon.
6534,2.7300000000000004,"her barrister, lilian moore, competent, intelligent, charming, was a young woman from dun laoghaire."
6535,0.64,we met her in her chambers in gray's inn.
6536,-2.4629999999999996,"i sat in a corner while she talked miranda out of a ""not guilty"" plea, her first impulse."
6537,-0.24,it was not difficult.
6538,-1.758,the prosecution was bound to make much of her recorded description of her revenge on gorringe.
6539,0.023000000000000007,"his statement, made from prison, dovetailed with hers."
6540,0.214,they were remembering the same evening.
6541,0.845,"miranda's ""not guilty"" plea would bring a longer sentence in the likely event of a successful prosecution."
6542,-1.32,"and, of course, she dreaded a trial."
6543,-0.6910000000000001,"a ""guilty"" plea was entered, though she tormented herself that she was somehow letting mariam down."
6544,1.1309999999999998,the april evening before she was due in court for sentencing was one of the strangest and saddest i have ever spent.
6545,-0.514,lilian had told miranda from the beginning that a custodial sentence was likely.
6546,0.10599999999999998,"she had packed a small suitcase and it stood by the door to our bedroom, a constant reminder."
6547,0.06700000000000006,i brought out my only bottle of decent wine.
6548,0.212,"the word ""last"" kept occurring to me, though i could not mention it."
6549,-0.548,"together we cooked a meal, perhaps a last meal."
6550,0.983,"when we raised a glass, it was not to her last evening of freedom, as i silently thought, but to mark."
6551,1.6039999999999999,"she had been to see him that afternoon and told him she might have to be away for work for a while, and that i would be coming to see him and take him out for treats."
6552,-0.3520000000000002,"he must have sensed there was some deeper meaning, some sorrow in this ""work."
6553,-0.712,one of the helpers had to prise his fingers from her skirt.
6554,0.22699999999999998,"during the meal, we tried to hold off an invading silence."
6555,-0.14400000000000002,we talked about the fiercely supportive women's groups who would be outside the old bailey the next morning.
6556,-0.76,we told each other how marvellous lilian was.
6557,0.6819999999999999,i reminded her of the judge's reputation for mildness.
6558,0.22599999999999987,"but at every turn, the silence came in like a tide and to speak again was an effort."
6559,0.13600000000000007,"when i said that it was as if she might be going into hospital tomorrow, the remark was not helpful."
6560,-0.392,"when i said i thought it was likely she would be eating with me at this table tomorrow night, that fell flat too."
6561,0.541,neither of us believed it.
6562,2.0900000000000003,"earlier in the day, in a better frame of mind, somewhat defiant, we had thought we would make love after dinner."
6563,0.089,another last.
6564,1.662,"now, in our sorrow, sex seemed like some long-abandoned pleasure, like playground skipping or dancing the twist."
6565,0.298,"her suitcase stood guard, barring entrance to the bedroom."
6566,1.2590000000000003,"next day in court, lilian made a brilliant speech in mitigation, conjuring for the judge the closeness of the two young women, the brutality of the assault, the vow of silence that mariam had imposed on the accused, the traumatising shock of her dearest friend's suicide and miranda's sincere desire for justice."
6567,3.535,"lilian referred to miranda's clean record, her recent marriage, her studies and, above all, her intended adoption of an underprivileged child."
6568,-0.689,"it was a statement in itself, a bleak one, that mariam's family were not in the public gallery."
6569,0.42200000000000004,"his honour's judgement was long, and i expected the worst."
6570,-0.36299999999999993,"he emphasised miranda's careful planning, the cunning execution, the deliberate and sustained deception of the court."
6571,0.08499999999999994,"he said that he accepted much of what lilian had said, and that he was being lenient when he sentenced miranda to serve one year."
6572,1.5050000000000001,"standing upright in the dock, in the business suit she had bought for the occasion, miranda appeared to freeze."
6573,1.762,i wanted her to look my way so that i could send her a sign of loving encouragement.
6574,0.511,but she was already locked up in her thoughts.
6575,-0.59,she told me later that at that moment she was confronting the implications of having a criminal record.
6576,0.16000000000000003,she was thinking of mark.
6577,-1.154,"until then, i would never considered what humiliation it was, to be taken down the courtroom steps and escorted to prison--by force if you tried to resist."
6578,0.6059999999999999,"her term began in holloway prison, six months after the deed."
6579,1.217,adam's luminous love had triumphed.
6580,0.7819999999999999,"gorringe now had a reasonable basis on which to appeal his sentence: one outrage, not two, and time already served."
6581,-0.472,but the law moved slowly.
6582,1.388,cheaper and more efficient dna testing was undermining all kinds of convictions.
6583,1.345,all kinds of self-declared innocent men and women were clamouring to have their cases reopened.
6584,1.477,there was a logjam at the appeal court.
6585,0.718,"gorringe, only partly innocent, would have to wait."
6586,1.1989999999999998,"on miranda's first full day inside, i went to visit mark at his reception class in clapham old town."
6587,0.198,it was a single-storey prefabricated building by a victorian church.
6588,0.514,"as i walked up the path, passing under a heavily pollarded oak, i saw jasmin waiting for me by the entrance."
6589,-0.239,"i knew straight away, and felt that i had always known."
6590,-0.14899999999999994,"her tight expression, as i came closer, was confirmation."
6591,0.0,we had been refused.
6592,1.268,"she took me into the building and then, not into the classroom, but along a linoleum corridor to an office."
6593,1.0730000000000002,"as we passed, i saw mark through an interior window, standing at a low table with a few others, doing something with coloured wooden blocks."
6594,-0.34899999999999987,"i sat with a cup of weak coffee while jasmin told me how sorry she was, how the matter was out of her hands, though she had done her best."
6595,0.7829999999999999,we should have told her that there was a court case pending.
6596,1.345,she was investigating the appeal procedure.
6597,0.696,"in the meantime, she had managed to get a single concession from the bureaucracy."
6598,0.021000000000000046,"given the close attachment already formed, miranda would be allowed one audio-visual contact with mark each week."
6599,-0.27699999999999997,my attention was wandering.
6600,-0.728,i did not need to hear any more.
6601,0.8180000000000001,i was thinking only of that point in the afternoon when i would break the news to miranda.
6602,0.731,"when jasmin was finished, i said i had nothing to ask or say."
6603,-0.28700000000000014,"we stood, she gave me a quick hug and led me out of the building by another corridor that avoided the classroom."
6604,1.48,it was almost mid-morning break and mark had already been told i was not coming that day.
6605,1.0129999999999997,"he might not have cared, for early season snow was falling and all the children were excited."
6606,0.9629999999999996,"the next day he would be told again that i was not coming, and the same the next day, and the next, until his expectations began to fade."
6607,0.04700000000000001,"miranda served six months, three in holloway, the rest in an open prison north of ipswich."
6608,1.8409999999999997,"like many middle-class, educated criminals before her, she put in for a job in the prison library."
6609,0.26,but a number of famous poll-tax martyrs were still waiting for their release.
6610,0.674,"in both prisons, the library posts were already filled and there was a waiting list."
6611,-0.86,"in holloway, she took a course in industrial cleaning."
6612,0.086,"in suffolk, she worked in the nursery."
6613,-1.224,babies under one year were allowed to stay with their prisoner mothers.
6614,-2.417,"in my first few visits to holloway, it seemed to me that to lock someone up in this victorian monstrosity, or in any building, was a form of slow torture."
6615,-1.379,"the bright visiting room, its child art on the walls, the companionable plastic tables, the haze of tobacco smoke, the din of voices and wailing babies, were a front for institutional horror."
6616,0.913,but i was guiltily surprised by how quickly i became used to having my wife in prison.
6617,-0.76,i accustomed myself to her misery.
6618,1.3519999999999999,another surprise was maxfield's equanimity.
6619,-0.15399999999999997,"there was no avoiding it, miranda had to tell him the entire story."
6620,0.40899999999999986,"he applauded the motives for her crime, and just as easily accepted her punishment."
6621,-0.11699999999999999,he had spent a year in wandsworth in 1942 as a conscientious objector.
6622,-0.2,holloway did not trouble him.
6623,0.774,"while miranda was in london, the housekeeper brought him to see her twice a week and, according to miranda, was good company."
6624,-0.3229999999999999,we visitors were a community within which the incarceration of a loved one became a mere inconvenience.
6625,0.20200000000000007,"as we queued to be searched and checked in and out, we chatted cheerfully, too cheerfully, about our particular circumstances."
6626,0.202,"i belonged in a band of husbands, boyfriends, children, middle-aged parents."
6627,1.7759999999999998,most of us colluded in the view that we and the women we were visiting did not belong here at all.
6628,-0.542,it was a misfortune we learned to tolerate.
6629,0.671,"some of miranda's sister-inmates looked frightening, born to give and receive punishment."
6630,1.258,i would not have been as resilient as she was.
6631,-0.15799999999999984,"to conduct a conversation in the visitors' room, we sometimes had to double down and concentrate hard to shut out exchanges between people on our table."
6632,-1.692,"blame, threats, abuse, with ""fuck"" and its variants at every turn."
6633,-0.76,but there were always couples who mutely held hands and stared at each other.
6634,-0.9,i guessed they were in shock.
6635,0.5369999999999999,"when the session was over, i felt bad about my little surge of joy as i stepped outside into the clean london air of personal freedom."
6636,1.4819999999999998,"for the final week of miranda's incarceration, i travelled to ipswich and slept on the living-room sofa of an old school friend."
6637,2.0060000000000002,it was the time of an exceptional indian summer.
6638,-0.8049999999999999,i drove the fifteen miles each late afternoon to the open prison.
6639,0.20099999999999996,"by the time i arrived, miranda would be finishing work."
6640,-0.508,we sat on the grass in the shade by the reeds of a choked-up ornamental pond.
6641,0.931,here it was easy to forget that she was not free.
6642,-1.596,her weekly calls with mark had continued over the months and she worried desperately about him.
6643,0.29799999999999993,"he was closing up, he was slipping away from her."
6644,-0.35699999999999993,she was convinced that adam had helped bring the case against her in order to ruin her adoption prospects.
6645,-1.13,"he was always jealous of mark, she insisted."
6646,0.8250000000000001,adam was not designed to understand what it was to love a child.
6647,1.199,the concept of play was alien to him.
6648,-1.1159999999999999,"i was sceptical, but i heard her out and did not argue, not at this stage."
6649,-0.29,i understood her bitterness.
6650,3.418,"my unspoken view, which she would not have liked, was that adam was designed for goodness and truth."
6651,-1.149,he would be incapable of executing a cynical plan.
6652,0.594,"our appeal was delayed, partly because of illness, partly because the adoption agency was being radically reorganised."
6653,0.12,it was not until miranda was moved from holloway that the process officially began.
6654,1.769,there was a chance we could persuade the authorities that her criminal record was not relevant to the care she could provide.
6655,0.664,we had a good testimonial from jasmin.
6656,1.677,"during the summer, i was drawn into the kind of labyrinthine bureaucracy i would have associated with the declining ottoman empire."
6657,-0.8979999999999999,it depressed me to hear that mark had behavioural problems.
6658,0.027,"tantrums, bed-wetting, general naughtiness."
6659,1.083,"according to jasmin, he had been teased and bullied."
6660,0.0,he no longer danced or flitted about.
6661,-0.85,there was no talk of princesses.
6662,0.05899999999999994,i did not pass this on to miranda.
6663,3.3040000000000003,she would been consulting local maps and had a clear idea of what she wanted on her first day of freedom.
6664,0.608,"the morning i collected her, the weather was beginning to turn and a cool strong wind was blowing from the east."
6665,-0.5339999999999999,"we drove to manningtree, parked in a lay-by and set out on the raised footpath that follows the tidal river stour to the sea."
6666,-0.73,the weather hardly mattered.
6667,2.2190000000000003,what she had wanted and found was open space and a big sky.
6668,0.25999999999999995,it was low tide and the vast mudflats sparkled in intermittent sunshine.
6669,0.8619999999999999,tiny bright clouds raced across a deep blue sky.
6670,0.631,miranda skipped along the dyke and kept punching the air.
6671,1.0390000000000001,"we walked six miles before lunch, which i would prepared as a picnic, at her request."
6672,0.5640000000000001,to eat it we needed to get out of the wind.
6673,-0.24300000000000005,"we came away from the river to shelter against a barn of corrugated iron, with a view of coils of rusting barbed wire partially submerged in beds of nettles."
6674,0.508,but that did not matter.
6675,1.39,"she was joyful, animated, full of plans."
6676,2.348,"i would been keeping it from her as a surprise, and now i told her that during her time inside i would saved almost ps1,000."
6677,0.0,"she was impressed, delighted, and she hugged and kissed me."
6678,0.583,then she was suddenly serious.
6679,-0.83,i hate him.
6680,-1.2999999999999998,"i want him out of the flat."""
6681,-0.395,"adam remained concealed in the cupboard in the hall, just as we had left him following the deed."
6682,-0.394,i had not carried out his final request.
6683,-0.441,he was too heavy and awkward for me to lift alone
6684,1.9579999999999997,and i did not want to ask for help.
6685,-0.3710000000000001,i felt both guilt and resentment and tried not to think about him.
6686,0.438,the wind shook the barn's roof and made a booming sound.
6687,1.183,i took her hand and made my promise.
6688,0.591,"but we did not, not immediately."
6689,0.3739999999999999,"when we arrived home, there was a letter for us on the doormat."
6690,1.017,it was an apology for the slowness of the appeal process.
6691,1.685,"our case was under further review, and we would hear a decision very soon."
6692,-0.73,jasmin--very much on our side--sent a neutral note.
6693,0.833,she did not want to get our hopes up.
6694,-0.995,"over the months, it had sometimes seemed to go our way, other times it looked like a lost because."
6695,-0.9980000000000001,against us: it was bureaucratically inefficient to make an exception to the rule--a criminal record nullified an adoption request.
6696,3.011,"for us: jasmin's reference, our heartfelt statements, and mark's love for miranda."
6697,0.023,i had not yet made it into his cast of significant adults.
6698,0.493,"we were man and wife, together again in our own strange alignment of two tiny flats."
6699,0.573,we were in a mood to celebrate.
6700,0.17600000000000005,"what were we doing, eating dry cheese sandwiches by a collapsing barn when here we had wine, lovemaking and a chicken to defrost?"
6701,3.567,"the day after we came back, we had friends round for a homecoming party."
6702,-0.9700000000000002,"the next day we spent sleeping, then clearing up and sleeping again."
6703,2.352,"the day after that, i set about earning some money, though with minimal success."
6704,1.04,miranda put her academic work in order and went to the university to re-register for her course.
6705,-1.0130000000000001,"her freedom still amazed her: privacy and relative silence, and small things, like walking from one room to another, opening her wardrobe to find her clothes, going to the fridge to take what she wanted, stepping unchallenged into the street."
6706,-0.786,an afternoon with the college bureaucracy diminished the elation somewhat.
6707,0.7139999999999997,"by the next morning, she was beginning to feel back in the world and the inert presence in the hallway cupboard oppressed her, just as it had in prospect."
6708,0.955,"she said that whenever she passed near, she felt a radioactive presence."
6709,0.0,i understood.
6710,0.214,i sometimes felt the same.
6711,0.44800000000000006,it took half a day on the phone to arrange a visit to the king's cross lab.
6712,1.613,it so happened that my appointment would fall on the day we were expecting the final decision on our appeal.
6713,0.032,we would been told we would hear by midday.
6714,0.691,i rented a van for twenty-four hours.
6715,0.21100000000000002,"under my bed, jammed against the skirting board, was the disposable stretcher that had come with my purchase."
6716,-0.23299999999999998,i took it into the garden and dusted it down.
6717,-0.20200000000000018,"miranda said she did not want to be involved in the removal, but there was no way round it."
6718,0.23299999999999998,i needed her help carrying him to the van.
6719,-0.04300000000000004,"before that, i thought that i could get him out of the cupboard unaided and drag him onto the stretcher while she remained in our study, working on an essay."
6720,3.113,"when i opened the cupboard door for the first time in nearly a year, i realised that just below the level of conscious expectation, i would been anticipating a putrefying stench."
6721,0.19799999999999984,"there was no good reason, i told myself, for my pulse rate to rise as i pulled away the tennis and squash rackets and the first of the coats."
6722,2.1950000000000003,now his left ear was visible.
6723,0.823,i stepped back.
6724,-0.9,"it was not a murder, this was not a corpse."
6725,0.05399999999999994,my visceral repulsion was born of hostility.
6726,-1.3849999999999998,"he had abused our hospitality, betrayed his own declared love, inflicted misery and humiliation on miranda, loneliness on me and deprivation on mark."
6727,0.893,i no longer felt sanguine about the appeal.
6728,-0.5019999999999999,i dragged an old winter coat from across adam's shoulders.
6729,-1.147,"i could see the dent on the top of his head, beneath the dark hair, which gleamed with artificial life."
6730,-0.8360000000000001,next to come away was a skiing jacket.
6731,-0.71,now his head and shoulders were revealed.
6732,1.13,"it was a relief that his eyes were closed, though i did not remember lowering the lids."
6733,0.028999999999999942,"here was his dark suit, beneath it the clean white shirt with rolled button-down collar, as crisp as if he had put it on an hour before."
6734,0.5920000000000001,these were his going-away clothes.
6735,1.3980000000000001,when he believed he was leaving us to meet his maker.
6736,2.2969999999999997,"a faint scent of refined instrument oil had accumulated in the confined space, and once more i recalled my father's sax."
6737,-1.5970000000000002,"how far bebop had travelled, from the wild basements of manhattan to the stifling constraints of my childhood."
6738,-0.82,irrelevant.
6739,-0.11700000000000002,i pulled away a blanket and the last of the coats.
6740,-0.63,now he was fully exposed.
6741,1.0819999999999999,"he sat wedged sideways, with his back to the side of the cupboard, knees drawn up."
6742,-0.041000000000000036,he resembled a man who had drifted to the bottom of a dry well.
6743,1.18,hard not to think he was biding his time.
6744,-0.5910000000000001,"his black shoes shone, the laces were tied, both hands rested in his lap."
6745,0.0,had i placed them there?
6746,-0.65,his complexion was unchanged.
6747,0.513,he looked healthy.
6748,0.612,"in repose, the face was thoughtful rather than cruel."
6749,0.06299999999999994,i was reluctant to touch him.
6750,0.9850000000000001,"as i put a hand on his shoulder, i tentatively said his name, and then again, as if i was trying to keep a hostile dog at bay."

6752,3.2699999999999996,"i cupped my free hand round his neck, which seemed warm to the touch, and pulled him over, onto his side."
6753,0.5329999999999999,"before he hit the cupboard floor, i caught him in an awkward embrace."
6754,-0.653,this was a dead weight.
6755,0.2800000000000001,the fabric of his suit jacket became bunched up against my face as i lowered him.
6756,0.6529999999999999,"i got my hands into his armpits and, with immense difficulty and much grunting, twisted him onto his back while dragging him from his confinement."
6757,0.269,not easy.

6762,0.1429999999999999,but i was beginning not to care.
6763,0.7190000000000001,"i pulled him out, inches at a time, and rolled him onto the stretcher."
6764,0.354,i straightened his legs by pushing down on his knees with my foot.
6765,2.319,"for mirandas benefit, i covered him, face included, with the blanket."
6766,1.709,enough magical thought.
6767,0.789,my attitude now was brisk.

6774,0.0,"i secured the doors, and as i turned she kissed me,"

6776,0.112,she did not want to come with me.
6777,0.723,she would stay at home and wait for the phone call from jasmin.
6778,-0.657,"we had not heard anything by twelve thirty, so i set off."
6779,-2.218,"i took my usual route towards vauxhall and waterloo bridge, but i was still a mile from the river and i was in heavy traffic."

6785,-0.7669999999999999,half the government and half the opposition were against healey's decision not to leave the european union.
6786,1.149,international lenders were imposing further spending cuts on a government that had promised to spend more.
6787,0.5519999999999999,the fate of the nation's nuclear weapons was not yet resolved.
6788,-1.16,the old arguments were bitter.
6789,0.6360000000000001,half the labour party membership wanted healey out.
6790,1.981,"some wanted a general election, others wanted their own man or woman in place."
6791,0.7799999999999999,"there were calls, derided here, applauded there, for a national government."

6800,0.03,no news.

6803,0.17499999999999982,"it was a wheelchair of the minimal, upright, tubular-steel design once used in hospitals."
6804,2.3810000000000002,"it was dented and grubby, with frayed security straps, but the wheels turned well enough and after some haggling, i paid ps2 for it."
6805,-1.6669999999999998,the junk-shop owner helped me lift what i told him was a water-filled mannequin out of the van and into the chair.
6806,1.035,he did not ask me what the water was for.
6807,1.8889999999999998,i tightened the chest and waist security straps more forcefully than any sentient being could have tolerated.
6808,-0.5339999999999999,"i stowed the stretcher, locked the van and began the long trudge northwards."
6809,-0.7369999999999999,the chair was as heavy as its burden and one wheel squeaked under the weight.
6810,-0.27599999999999997,none of its fellows turned as easily as they had when the chair was empty.
6811,1.0219999999999998,"if the pavements had been deserted, it would have been hard enough, but they were as jammed as the roads."
6812,-1.3980000000000001,it was the usual conundrum--people were flowing away from the march just as thousands were surging towards it.
6813,0.9460000000000001,"at the slightest incline, i had to double my efforts."
6814,0.026,i crossed the river at vauxhall bridge and passed by the tate gallery.
6815,0.3810000000000001,"by the time i reached parliament square and was starting along whitehall, the front wheels began to tighten against their axles."
6816,-1.471,i was grunting at each step with the effort.
6817,-0.07699999999999996,"i imagined myself as a servant in pre-industrial times, transporting my impassive lord to his leisured appointment, where i would wait, thankless, to carry him back."
6818,-0.56,i would almost forgotten the purpose of my exertions.
6819,0.741,all i knew was getting to king's cross.
6820,-0.664,but now my progress was blocked.
6821,1.0230000000000001,trafalgar square was packed tight for speeches.
6822,-0.761,we approached on an explosion of applause and shouting.
6823,-2.329,"the litter under my feet, thin streamers of fine plastic, tangled with the wheels."
6824,-0.4540000000000002,i risked being trampled by going down below knee level to pull the mess clear.
6825,0.09100000000000008,"it was going to take me a long time to reach the charing cross road, 200 yards away."
6826,1.284,no one wanted or was able to give way.
6827,-0.104,it was no easier to retreat than to advance.
6828,-0.08100000000000007,all the side streets were filling now.
6829,-0.42700000000000005,"the din, the clatter, the foghorns, bass drums, whistles and chants were both thunderous and piercing."
6830,-0.8180000000000001,"as i fought to edge his lordship forward, i penetrated--but so slowly--layers of disappointment and anger, confusion and blame."
6831,1.097,"poverty, unemployment, housing, healthcare and care for the old, education, crime, race, gender, climate, opportunity--every old problem of social existence remained unsolved, according to all the voices, placards, t-shirts and banners."
6832,-0.18,who could doubt them?
6833,2.431,it was a great clamour for something better.
6834,-2.181,"and pushing my dirty broken chair, its complaining wheel lost to the din, i squeezed through the crowd unnoticed, with a new problem about to be added to the rest--wondrous machines like adam and his kind, whose moment had not quite yet come."
6835,-0.050000000000000044,making progress up st. martin's lane was just as hard.
6836,0.27,"further north, the crowds began to thin."
6837,2.0860000000000003,"but just as i reached new oxford street, the noisy wheel locked and for the rest of the way i had to lift and tilt the chair as well as push."
6838,1.152,i stopped at a pub near the british museum and drank a pint of shandy.
6839,0.089,"from there, i phoned miranda again."
6840,-0.86,still no news.
6841,1.8569999999999998,i arrived three hours late for my appointment at york way.
6842,0.6900000000000002,a security guard behind a long curving slab of marble made a call and asked me to sign myself in.
6843,-0.5800000000000001,"after ten minutes, two assistants came and took adam away."
6844,0.287,one of them returned half an hour later to take me up to meet the director.
6845,0.861,the lab was a long room on the seventh floor.
6846,-0.16900000000000012,under a glare of strip lighting were two stainless-steel tables.
6847,0.6359999999999999,"on one of them was adam, no longer a lord, on his back, still in his best clothes, with a power cable trailing from his midriff."
6848,0.4010000000000001,"on the other table was a head, gleaming black and muscular, standing upright on its truncated neck."
6849,0.0,another adam.
6850,0.155,"the nose, i noticed, with its broad and complex surfaces, was kinder, friendlier than our adam's."
6851,0.8380000000000001,"the eyes were open, the gaze was watchful."
6852,0.9439999999999998,"my father would have known for sure, but i thought there was a strong resemblance, or at least a reference, to the young charlie parker."
6853,0.020000000000000018,"he had a studied look, as though he was counting himself in on some complex musical phrase."
6854,0.756,i wondered why my purchase had not also been modelled after a genius.
6855,0.761,there were a couple of open laptops by adam.
6856,-1.3359999999999999,"i was going forward to look at them when a voice behind me said, ""i here's nothing as yet."
6857,0.571,"you really did for him."""
6858,0.67,"i turned, and as i shook turing's hand, he said, ""was it a hammer?"""
6859,-0.9199999999999999,he led me down a long corridor to a cramped corner office where there was a good view to the west and south.
6860,2.613,"here we stayed, drinking coffee for almost two hours."
6861,-0.96,there was no small talk.
6862,0.955,"naturally, the first question was what had brought me to this act of destruction."
6863,0.2889999999999999,"to answer, i told him everything i had omitted before, all that had happened since, ending with adam's symmetrical notion of justice and its threat to the adoption process as the because of ""the deed."""
6864,0.566,"as before, turing took notes, and interrupted occasionally for clarification."
6865,0.627,he wanted details of the hammer blow.
6866,0.455,how close was i?
6867,0.0,what sort of hammer?
6868,0.0,how heavy?
6869,-0.018000000000000127,did i use full force and both hands?
6870,-0.32499999999999996,"i spoke of adam's dying request, which i was now fulfilling."
6871,1.1360000000000001,"about the suicides and the recall of all the adams and eves, i said i was sure that he, turing, knew a lot more than i did."
6872,-0.171,"from far away, in the direction of the demonstration, came the rattle of a snare drum and the thrilling notes of a hunting horn."
6873,-0.578,the thick cloud cover was partly breaking up in the west and glints of the setting sun
6874,0.036,touched turing's office.
6875,0.8140000000000001,he continued writing after i had finished
6876,1.332,and i was able to watch him unobserved.
6877,0.774,"he wore a grey suit and pale green silk shirt without a tie, and on his feet brogues of matching green."
6878,0.015000000000000041,the sun caught one side of his face as he made his notes.
6879,0.7,"he looked very fine, i thought."
6880,0.40199999999999997,at last he was done and clipped his pen inside his jacket and closed the notebook.
6881,0.514,he regarded me thoughtfully--
6882,0.48699999999999993,"i could not hold his gaze--then he looked away, pursing his lips and tapping the desk with a forefinger."
6883,1.56,i have no privileged information on the suicides.
6884,0.0,only my suspicions.
6885,1.055,"i think the a-and-es were illequipped to understand human decision-making, the way our principles are warped in the force field of our emotions, our peculiar biases, our self-delusion and all the other well-charted defects of our cognition."
6886,-0.559,soon these adams and eves were in despair.
6887,0.8170000000000001,"they could not understand us, because we could not understand ourselves."
6888,2.138,their learning programs could not accommodate us.
6889,0.9159999999999999,"if we did not know our own minds, how could we design theirs and expect them to be happy alongside us?"
6890,0.207,"but that is just my hypothesis."""
6891,-0.4750000000000001,he fell silent for a short while and seemed to make a decision.
6892,2.187,"thirty years ago, in the early fifties, i got into trouble with the law for having a homosexual relationship."
6893,0.713,you might have heard about it.
6894,-0.54,i was contemptuous.
6895,-0.812,"this was a consenting matter, it caused no harm and"
6896,0.4730000000000001,"i knew there was plenty of it about at every level, including that of my accusers."
6897,-0.2,"but of course it was also devastating, for me and especially for my mother."
6898,-0.7849999999999999,social disgrace.
6899,0.421,i was an object of public disgust.

6901,-0.10500000000000004,"from my war work, obviously, i knew a lot of secrets."
6902,0.16599999999999993,"it was that old recursive nonsense--the state makes a crime of what you do, what you are, then disowns you for being vulnerable to blackmail."
6903,1.8880000000000003,"the conventional view was that homosexuality was a revolting crime, a perversion of all that was good and a threat to the social order."
6904,-0.46599999999999997,"but in certain enlightened, scientifically objective circles, it was a sickness and the sufferer should not be blamed."
6905,1.163,"fortunately, a cure was on hand."

6910,-1.182,not simply to stay out of prison.
6911,0.314,i was curious.
6912,1.315,i could rise above the whole business by regarding it as an experiment.
6913,2.085,what could a complex compound like a hormone do to a body and a mind?
6914,0.222,i would make my own observations.
6915,2.4789999999999996,"hard now, looking back, to feel the attraction of what i thought then."
6916,1.304,in those days i had a highly mechanistic view of what a person was.
6917,1.9500000000000002,"the body was a machine, an extraordinary one, and the mind i thought of mostly in terms of intelligence, which was best modelled by reference to chess or maths."
6918,-1.2000000000000002,"simplistic, but it was what i could work with."""
6919,1.6990000000000003,"once again, i was flattered that he should confide in me such intimate details, some of which i already knew."

6921,0.555,i suspected that he was leading me somewhere.
6922,0.35300000000000004,his sharp gaze made me feel stupid.
6923,1.44,"in his voice, i thought i heard the faint remnants of that impatient, clipped tone familiar from wartime broadcasts."
