Moisture beads were forming on the bottle. Turing poured.
We tilted our glasses in a token toast.

retrospect. It was fed thousands of games. At every move, it
ran through all the possibilities at speed. The more you under-

was a significant moment. To the public, it was close to magi-
cal. A mere machine inflicting intellectual defeat on the best
minds in the world. It looked like artificial intelligence at the
highest level, but it was more like an elaborate card trick.
"Over the next fifteen years a lot of good people came
into computer science. Work on neural networks advanced by
many hands, the hardware got faster and smaller and cheaper,
and ideas were trading at a faster rate too. And it goes on.
I remember being in Santa Barbara with Demis in 1965 to
speak at a machine-learning conference. We had 7,000, most
of them bright kids even younger than you. Chinese, Indians,
Koreans, Vietnamese as well as westerners. The whole planet

I was aware of the history from the research for my book.
I also knew something of Turing's personal story. I wanted to
let him know that I wasn't completely ignorant.
I said, "A long road from Bletchley."
He blinked this irrelevance away. "After various dis-
