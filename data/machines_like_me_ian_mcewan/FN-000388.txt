of replicating the human brain. But every tiny problem we
solved, a million others would pop up. Have you any idea what
it takes to catch a ball, or raise a cup to your lips, or make
immediate sense of a word, a phrase or an ambiguous sentence?
We didn't, not at first. Solving maths problems is the tiniest
fraction of what human intelligence does. We learned from

litre, liquid-cooled, three-dimensional computer. Unbeliev-
able processing power, unbelievably compressed, unbelievable
energy efficiency, no overheating. The whole thing running on
twenty-five watts—one dim light bulb."
He looked at me closely as he lingered on this last phrase.
It was an indictment: the dimness was mine. I wanted to speak

"We made our best work freely available and encouraged
everyone to do the same. And they did. Hundreds, if not a
thousand, labs around the world, sharing and solving count-
less problems. These Adams and Eves, the A-and-Es, are one of
the results. We're all very proud here that so much of our work
was incorporated. These are beautiful, beautiful machines.

in science has been little more than a fashion parade. Freud,
behaviourism, cognitive psychology. Scraps of insight. Noth-

nomics a good name."
