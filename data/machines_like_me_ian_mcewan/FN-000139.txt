Adam stood. Years ago, Simon had cleared his top shelf of soft
porn in favour of specialist stuff—literary magazines, aca-
demic bulletins of international relations, history, entomology.
A fair number of ageing, down-at-heel intellectuals lived in
the neighbourhood.
As I turned away he added, "You can get it yourself?" A
gentle tease to lower the tension. Simon was taller and he usu-
ally reached up for me.
A single word brought Adam to life. With the faintest
whirring sound, which I hoped only I could hear, he turned to
address Simon in formal terms. "Your self, you say. There's a
coincidence. I've been giving some thought lately to the mys-
tery of the self. Some say it's an organic element or process
embedded in neural structures. Others insist that it's an illu-
sion, a by-product of our narrative tendencies."
There was a silence, then, stiffening a little, Simon said,
"Well, sir, which is it? What have you decided?"
"It's the way I'm made. I'm bound to conclude that I've a
very powerful sense of self and I'm certain that it's real and
that neuroscience will describe it fully one day. Even when it
does, I won't know this self any better than I do now. But I do
have moments of doubt when I wonder whether I'm subject to
a form of Cartesian error."
By this time I had the journal in my hands and was pre-
paring to leave. "Take the Buddhists," Simon said. "They pre-
fer to get along without a self."
"Indeed. I'd like to meet one. Do you know any?"
Simon was emphatic. "No, sir. Absolutely, I do not."
