tens of thousands of jobs around the world in diverse fields-
computer graphics, medical scanning devices, particle accel-
erators, protein folding, smart electricity distribution, defence,
space exploration. No one could guess the end of such a list.
By living openly from 1969 with his lover, Tom Reah, the
theoretical physicist who would win the Nobel Prize in 1989,
Turing helped give weight to a gathering social revolution.
When the AIDS epidemic broke out he raised a huge sum to
set up a virology institute in Dundee and was co-founder of a
hospice. After the first effective treatments appeared, he cam-

on his work in "my shrinking years." Behind him were his
long residency in San Francisco, the Presidential Medal of
Freedom and a banquet in his honour with President Carter,
lunch with Mrs. Thatcher at Chequers to discuss science fund-
ing, dinner with the President of Brazil to persuade him to
protect the Amazon. For a long while he was the face of the
computer revolution, and the voice of the new genetics, almost
as famous as Stephen Hawking. Now he was a near-recluse.
His only journeys were between his house in Camden Town
and his institute in King's Cross, two doors down from the
Hassabis Centre.
Reah wrote a long poem about his and Turing's life
together, published in the TLS and then in book form. The
poet and critic Ian Hamilton said in a review, "Here is a physi-
cist who can imagine as well as scan. Now bring me the poet
