tions that I wanted to explore. I was interested in Paul Dirac's
work. Above all, I wanted to understand what quantum
mechanics could teach computer science. Few interruptions,
of course. Access to a few books. People from King's and Man-
chester and elsewhere came to visit. My friends never let me
down. As for the intelligence world, they had me where they
wanted me and they left me alone, f was free! I did my best
year's work since we broke the Enigma code in '41. Or since
the computer logic papers 1 wrote in the mid-thirties. I even
made some headway with the P versus NP problem, though
it wasn't formulated in those terms for another lifteen years.
I was excited by Crick and Watson's paper on the structure of
DNA. I began to work on the first sketches that led eventually
to winner-take-all DNA neural networks—the sort of thing
that helped make Adam and Eve possible."
It was while Turing was telling me about his first year
after Wandsworth, how he cut loose from the National Physi-
cal Laboratory and the universities and set up on his own, that
I felt my phone vibrating in my trouser pocket. An incoming
text. Miranda, with the news. I longed to see it. But I had to
ignore it.
Turing was saying, "We had money from some friends in
the States and from a couple of people here. We were a bril-
liant team. Old Bletchley. The best. Our first job was to make
ourselves financially independent. We designed a business
computer to calculate weekly wages for big companies. It took
us four years to pay back our generous friends. 1 hen we settled
down to serious artificial intelligence, and this is the point of
my story. At the start, we thought we were within ten years
