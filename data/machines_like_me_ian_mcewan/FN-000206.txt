cially around the dents in the bodywork. The wing mirrors
had snapped or been snapped off. There was a long white rip in
the driver's seat and a piece of the steering wheel, from eleven
to three o'clock, was missing. Years ago, a girl had been sick on
the back seat after a rowdy Indian dinner and not even profes-
sional steam-cleaning could erase the scent of vindaloo. The
Urbala had only two doors and it was awkward to get an adult
into the back seat. But there was little to go wrong with these
engines and the car ran smooth and fast. It was an automatic
and easy to drive with one hand.
I took my usual route, singing all the way, to Vauxhall,
then downstream with the river on my left, past Lambeth Pal-
ace and the abandoned St. Thomas's Hospital, where scores or
hundreds of the homeless squatted. The windscreen wiper on
the driver's side worked every ten seconds or so. The wiper
on the passenger side thumped out a beat to my pop tunes. I
crossed the Thames by Waterloo Bridge—in both directions,
best views in town—then slipped down to take the sinuous
curves of the old tram tunnel at speed and burst in triumph
into Holborn—not the shortest route to Soho, but my favour-
ite. I was hitting some high notes on a new Lennon song.
What was right with me? Thirty-three today and in love.
The unaccountable brew of hormone cocktails—endorphins,
dopamine, oxytocin and all the rest. Cause or effect or associ-
ation—we knew next to nothing about our passing moods. It
seemed objectionable that they should have a material base.
On this particular evening, I hadn't touched grass or even had
a sip of wine—there was nothing in the house. Yesterday I had
been almost thirty-three and in love and I hadn't felt like this.
