his reception class in Clapham Old Town. It was a single-storey
prefabricated building by a Victorian church. As I walked up
the path, passing under a heavily pollarded oak, I saw Jasmin
waiting for me by the entrance. I knew straight away, and felt
that I had always known. Her tight expression, as I came closer,
was confirmation. We had been refused. She took me into the
building and then, not into the classroom, but along a lino-
leum corridor to an office. As we passed, I saw Mark through
an interior window, standing at a low table with a few others,
doing something with coloured wooden blocks. I sat with a cup
of weak coffee while Jasmin told me how sorry she was, how
the matter was out of her hands, though she had done her best.
We should have told her that there was a court case pending.
She was investigating the appeal procedure. In the meantime,
she had managed to get a single concession from the bureauc-
racy. Given the close attachment already formed, Miranda
would be allowed one audio-visual contact with Mark each
week. My attention was wandering. I didn't need to hear any
more. I was thinking only of that point in the afternoon when
I would break the news to Miranda.
When Jasmin was finished, I said I had nothing to ask or
say. We stood, she gave me a quick hug and led me out of the
building by another corridor that avoided the classroom. It was
almost mid-morning break and Mark had already been told
I wasn't coming that day. He might not have cared, for early
season snow was falling and all the children were excited. The
next day he would be told again that I wasn't coming, and the
same the next day, and the next, until his expectations began
to fade.
