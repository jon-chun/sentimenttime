"And I do." He spoke to her softly, as if I wasn't there. "Do
you remember the poem I wrote for you that began, 'Love is
luminous'?"
"No."

"It went on, 'The dark corners are exposed.
"I don't care." Her voice was small.
"One of the darkest corners is revenge. It's a crude impulse.
A culture of revenge leads to private misery, bloodshed, anar-
chy, social breakdown. Love is a pure light and that's what I
want to see you by. Revenge has no place in our love."
"Our?"
"Or mine. The principle stands."
Miranda was finding strength in anger. "Let me get this
clear. You want me to go to prison."
"I'm disappointed. I thought you'd appreciate the logic
of this. I want you to confront your actions and accept what
the law decides. When you do, I promise you, you'll feel great
relief."
"Have you forgotten? I'm about to adopt a child."
"If necessary, Charlie can look after Mark. It will bring
them close, which is what you wanted. Thousands of children
suffer because they have a parent in prison. Pregnant women
receive custodial sentences. Why should you be exempt?"
Her contempt was set free. "You don't understand. Or
you're not capable of understanding. If I get a criminal record,
we won't be allowed to adopt. That's the rule. Mark will be
lost. You've no idea what it is to be a child in care. Different
institutions, different foster parents, different social workers.
No one close to him, no one loving him."
