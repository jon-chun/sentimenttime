His tone was prompt and calm. "Invasion, success or fail-
ure. Negotiated settlement, success or failure. Four outcomes
or effects. Without benefit of hindsight, we'd have to choose
which causes to pursue, which to avoid. We'd be in the realm
of Bayesian inverse probability. We'd be looking for the prob-
able cause of an effect rather than the most likely effect of a
cause. Only sensible, to try and find a formal representation of
our guesswork. Our reference point, our datum, would be an
observer of the Falklands situation before any decisions were
taken. Certain a priori probability values are ascribed to the
four outcomes. As fresh information comes in, we can measure
relative changes in probability. But we can't possess an abso-
lute value. It may help us to define the weight of new evidence
logarithmically, so that, assuming a base ten—"
