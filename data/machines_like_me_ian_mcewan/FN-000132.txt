had published 190 of his accounts.
Suppose there had been a young spark at the Royal Society
lolling in the library after a good lunch, a copy of the Trans-
actions on his lap, who began to speculate that some of these
tiny organisms might cause meat to putrefy, or could multiply
in the bloodstream and cause disease. There had been such
sparks at the Society before and there were many to come. But
this one would have needed an interest in medicine as well
as scientific curiosity. Medicine and science would not become
full partners until well into the twentieth century. Even in
the fifties, tonsils were regularly sliced from the throats of
healthy children on the basis of standard practice rather than
good evidence. A doctor in Leeuwenhoek's time could easily
believe that everything to be known in his field was already
well understood. The authority of Galen, active in the second
century, was near total. It would be a long time before medical
men, in general a grand lot, peered humbly down a micro-
scope in order to learn the basics of organic life.
But our man, whose name will become a household word,
is different. His hypotheses will be possible to test. He bor-
rows a microscope—Robert Hooke, honoured fellow of the
Society, will surely lend him one—and sets to. A germ theory
of disease begins to form. Others join in the research. Per-
haps within twenty years surgeons are washing their hands
between patients. The reputations of forgotten doctors like
Hugh of Lucca and Girolamo Fracastoro are restored. By the
mid-eighteenth century, childbirth is safer; certain men and
