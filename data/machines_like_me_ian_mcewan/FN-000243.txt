Machines Like Me

with Adam in attendance, and set off to cross London to Tur-
ing's house in Camden Square. I was flattered and awed by
the summons. With a touch of youthful self-regard, I won-
dered if he'd read my short book on artificial intelligence, in
which I'd praised him. We were bound by our ownership of
highly advanced machines. I liked to think I was an expert
on the early days of computing. Possibly he wanted to take
issue with me on the way I had placed such emphasis on the
role of Nikola Tesla. He had come to Britain in 1906 after the
collapse of his radio-transmission project at Wardenclyffe,
New York. He joined the National Physical Laboratory, some-
thing of a demotion and a blow to his vanity, and helped in
the arms race against Germany. He not only developed radar
and radio-guided torpedoes, but was the inspiration for the
famous "foundational surge" that produced electronic com-
puters capable of making calculations for artillery fire in the
coming war. In the twenties he had been instrumental in the
development of the first transistors. Notes and sketches for a
silicon chip were found among his papers after he died.
I had written in my book about the celebrated meeting
between Tesla and Turing in 1941. The old Serb, immensely
tall and thin, and inconveniently trembling, only eighteen
months away from death, said in an after-dinner speech at the
Dorchester that their conversation had "reached for the stars."
Turing's only comment, made to a newspaper, was that they
had exchanged nothing but small talk. At the time he was
working in secret at Bletchley on a computer to crack Ger-
man naval Enigma codes. He would have taken care to be
circumspect.
