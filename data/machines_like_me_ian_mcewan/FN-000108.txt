MBDA, had sold to the Argentine government. This fearsome
weapon, once fired from a jet in the general direction of a
ship, could recognise its profile and decide mid-flight whether

and plunged harmlessly into the sea. If it missed its target
and overshot, it was able to double back and make two more
attempts. It closed on its prey at 5,000 miles an hour. Its opt-

that Turing developed in the mid-sixties. He had been look-

Argentina's ally, was blocked. But other countries, including
