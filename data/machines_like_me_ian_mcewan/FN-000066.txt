films and TV dramas, as if human actors, walking with a cer-
tain glazed look, phony head movements, some stiffness in the
lower back, could prepare us for life with our cousins from the
future.
I was among the optimists, blessed by unexpected funds
following my mother's death and the sale of the family home,
which turned out to be on a valuable development site. The
first truly viable manufactured human with plausible intel-
ligence and looks, believable motion and shifts of expression,
went on sale the week before the Falklands Task Force set off
on its hopeless mission. Adam cost £86,000. I brought him
home in a hired van to my unpleasant flat in north Clapham.
I'd made a reckless decision, but I was encouraged by reports
that Sir Alan Turing, war hero and presiding genius of the
digital age, had taken delivery of the same model. Fie probably
wanted to have his lab take it apart to examine its workings
fully.
Twelve of this first edition were called Adam, thirteen
were called Eve. Corny, everyone agreed, but commercial.
Notions of biological race being scientifically discredited,
the twenty-five were designed to cover a range of ethnicities.
There were rumours, then complaints, that the Arab could not
be told apart from the Jew. Random programming as well as
life experience would grant to all complete latitude in sexual
preference. By the end of the first week, all the Eves sold out.
At a careless glance, I might have taken my Adam for a Turk
or a Greek. He weighed 170 pounds, so I had to ask my upstairs
neighbour, Miranda, to help me carry him in from the street
on the disposable stretcher that came with the purchase.
