If she finished it tonight, if they did go to the Lighthouse after all, it was to be given to the Lighthouse keeper for his little boy, who was threatened with a tuberculous hip; together with a pile of old magazines, and some tobacco, indeed, whatever she could find lying about, not really wanted, but only littering the room, to give those poor fellows, who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden, something to amuse them.

              "'yes of course if it is fine tomorrow said mrs ramsay but you will have to be up with the lark she added to her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy as if it were settled the expedition were bound to take place and the wonder to which he had looked forward for years and years it seemed was after a night own darkness and a day own sail within touch since he belonged even at the age of six to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that but must let future prospects with their joys and sorrows cloud what is actually at hand since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests james ramsay sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the army and navy stores endowed the picture of a refrigerator as his mother spoke with heavenly bliss it was fringed with joy the wheelbarrow the lawnmower the sound of poplar trees leaves whitening before rain rooks cawing brooms knocking dresses rustling all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code his secret language though he appeared the image of stark and uncompromising severity with his high forehead and his fierce blue eyes impeccably candid and pure frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty so that his mother watching him guide his scissors neatly round the refrigerator imagined him all red and ermine on the bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of public affairs but said his father stopping in front of the drawing room window it will not be fine had there been an axe handy a poker or any weapon that would have gashed a hole in his father own breast and killed him there and then james would have seized it such were the extremes of emotion that mr ramsay excited in his children own breasts by his mere presence standing as now lean as a knife narrow as the blade of one grinning sarcastically not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was james thought but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement what he said was true it was always true he was incapable of untruth never tampered with a fact never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being least of all of his own children who sprung from his loins should be aware from childhood that life is difficult facts uncompromising and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished our frail barks founder in darkness here mr ramsay would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon one that needs above all courage truth and the power to endure but it may be fine i expect it will be fine said mrs ramsay making some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was knitting impatiently if she finished it tonight if they did go to the lighthouse after all it was to be given to the lighthouse keeper for his little boy who was threatened with a tuberculous hip together with a pile of old magazines and some tobacco indeed whatever she could find lying about not really wanted but only littering the room to give those poor fellows who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden something to amuse them for how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a time and possibly more in stormy weather upon a rock the size of a tennis lawn she would ask and to have no letters or newspapers and to see nobody if you were married not to see your wife not to know how your children were if they were ill if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms to see the same dreary waves breaking week after week and then a dreadful storm coming and the windows covered with spray and birds dashed against the lamp and the whole place rocking and not be able to put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea how would you like that she asked addressing herself particularly to her daughters so she added rather differently one must take them whatever comforts one can it is due west said the atheist tansley holding his bony fingers spread so that the wind blew through them for he was sharing mr ramsay own evening walk up and down up and down the terrace that is to say the wind blew from the worst possible direction for landing at the lighthouse yes he did say disagreeable things mrs ramsay admitted it was odious of him to rub this in and make james still more disappointed but at the same time she would not let them laugh at him the atheist they called him the little atheist rose mocked him prue mocked him andrew jasper roger mocked him even old badger without a tooth in his head had bit him for being as nancy put it the hundred and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the hebrides when it was ever so much nicer to be alone nonsense said mrs ramsay with great severity apart from the habit of exaggeration which they had from her and from the implication which was true that she asked too many people to stay and had to lodge some in the town she could not bear incivility to her guests to young men in particular who were poor as churchmice exceptionally able her husband said his great admirers and come there for a holiday indeed she had the whole of the other sex under her protection for reasons she could not explain for their chivalry and valour for the fact that they negotiated treaties ruled india controlled finance finally for an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to find agreeable something trustful childlike reverential which an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity and woe betide the girl pray heaven it was none of her daughters who did not feel the worth of it and all that it implied to the marrow of her bones she turned with severity upon nancy he had not chased them she said he had been asked they must find a way out of it all there might be some simpler way some less laborious way she sighed when she looked in the glass and saw her hair grey her cheek sunk at fifty she thought possibly she might have managed things better her husband money his books but for her own part she would never for a single second regret her decision evade difficulties or slur over duties she was now formidable to behold and it was only in silence looking up from their plates after she had spoken so severely about charles tansley that her daughters prue nancy rose could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers in paris perhaps a wilder life not always taking care of some man or other for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry of the bank of england and the indian empire of ringed fingers and lace though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts and made them as they sat at table beneath their mother own eyes honour her strange severity her extreme courtesy like a queen own raising from the mud to wash a beggar own dirty foot when she admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them or speaking accurately been invited to stay with them in the isle of skye there will be no landing at the lighthouse tomorrow said charles tansley clapping his hands together as he stood at the window with her husband surely he had said enough she wished they would both leave her and james alone and go on talking she looked at him he was such a miserable specimen the children said all humps and hollows he could not play cricket he poked he shuffled he was a sarcastic brute andrew said they knew what he liked best to be for ever walking up and down up and down with mr ramsay and saying who had won this who had won that who was a first rate man at latin verses who was brilliant but i think fundamentally unsound who was undoubtedly the ablest fellow in balliol who had buried his light temporarily at bristol or bedford but was bound to be heard of later when his prolegomena of which mr tansley had the first pages in proof with him if mr ramsay would like to see them to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day that was what they talked about she could not help laughing herself sometimes she said the other day something about waves mountains high yes said charles tansley it was a little rough are not you drenched to the skin she had said damp not wet through said mr tansley pinching his sleeve feeling his socks but it was not that they minded the children said it was not his face it was not his manners it was him his point of view when they talked about something interesting people music history anything even said it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors then what they complained of about charles tansley was that until he had turned the whole thing round and made it somehow reflect himself and disparage them he was not satisfied and he would go to picture galleries they said and he would ask one did one like his tie god knows said rose one did not disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner table directly the meal was over the eight sons and daughters of mr and mrs ramsay sought their bedrooms their fastness in a house where there was no other privacy to debate anything everything tansley own tie the passing of the reform bill sea birds and butterflies people while the sun poured into those attics which a plank alone separated from each other so that every footstep could be plainly heard and the swiss girl sobbing for her father who was dying of cancer in a valley of the grisons and lit up bats flannels straw hats ink pots paint pots beetles and the skulls of small birds while it drew from the long frilled strips of seaweed pinned to the wall a smell of salt and weeds which was in the towels too gritty with sand from bathing strife divisions difference of opinion prejudices twisted into the very fibre of being oh that they should begin so early mrs ramsay deplored they were so critical her children they talked such nonsense she went from the dining room holding james by the hand since he would not go with the others it seemed to her such nonsense inventing differences when people heaven knows were different enough without that the real differences she thought standing by the drawing room window are enough quite enough she had in mind at the moment rich and poor high and low the great in birth receiving from her half grudging some respect for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble if slightly mythical italian house whose daughters scattered about english drawing rooms in the nineteenth century had lisped so charmingly had stormed so wildly and all her wit and her bearing and her temper came from them and not from the sluggish english or the cold scotch but more profoundly she ruminated the other problem of rich and poor and the things she saw with her own eyes weekly daily here or in london when she visited this widow or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm and a note book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings employment and unemployment in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation half a relief to her own curiosity and become what with her untrained mind she greatly admired an investigator elucidating the social problem insoluble questions they were it seemed to her standing there holding james by the hand he had followed her into the drawing room that young man they laughed at he was standing by the table fidgeting with something awkwardly feeling himself out of things as she knew without looking round they had all gone the children minta doyle and paul rayley augustus carmichael her husband they had all gone so she turned with a sigh and said would it bore you to come with me mr tansley she had a dull errand in the town she had a letter or two to write she would be ten minutes perhaps she would put on her hat and with her basket and her parasol there she was again ten minutes later giving out a sense of being ready of being equipped for a jaunt which however she must interrupt for a moment as they passed the tennis lawn to ask mr carmichael who was basking with his yellow cat own eyes ajar so that like a cat own they seemed to reflect the branches moving or the clouds passing but to give no inkling of any inner thoughts or emotion whatsoever if he wanted anything for they were making the great expedition she said laughing they were going to the town stamps writing paper tobacco she suggested stopping by his side but no he wanted nothing his hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch his eyes blinked as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these blandishments she was seductive but a little nervous but could not sunk as he was in a grey green somnolence which embraced them all without need of words in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well wishing all the house all the world all the people in it for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something which accounted the children thought for the vivid streak of canary yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk white no nothing he murmured he should have been a great philosopher said mrs ramsay as they went down the road to the fishing village but he had made an unfortunate marriage holding her black parasol very erect and moving with an indescribable air of expectation as if she were going to meet some one round the corner she told the story an affair at oxford with some girl an early marriage poverty going to india translating a little poetry very beautifully i believe being willing to teach the boys persian or hindustanee but what really was the use of that and then lying as they saw him on the lawn it flattered him snubbed as he had been it soothed him that mrs ramsay should tell him this charles tansley revived insinuating too as she did the greatness of man own intellect even in its decay the subjection of all wives not that she blamed the girl and the marriage had been happy enough she believed to their husband own labours she made him feel better pleased with himself than he had done yet and he would have liked had they taken a cab for example to have paid the fare as for her little bag might he not carry that no no she said she always carried that herself she did too yes he felt that in her he felt many things something in particular that excited him and disturbed him for reasons which he could not give he would like her to see him gowned and hooded walking in a procession a fellowship a professorship he felt capable of anything and saw himself but what was she looking at at a man pasting a bill the vast flapping sheet flattened itself out and each shove of the brush revealed fresh legs hoops horses glistening reds and blues beautifully smooth until half the wall was covered with the advertisement of a circus a hundred horsemen twenty performing seals lions tigers craning forwards for she was short sighted she read it out will visit this town she read it was terribly dangerous work for a one armed man she exclaimed to stand on top of a ladder like that his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years ago let us all go she cried moving on as if all those riders and horses had filled her with childlike exultation and made her forget her pity let us go he said repeating her words clicking them out however with a self consciousness that made her wince let us all go to the circus no he could not say it right he could not feel it right but why not she wondered what was wrong with him then she liked him warmly at the moment had they not been taken she asked to circuses when they were children never he answered as if she asked the very thing he wanted had been longing all these days to say how they did not go to circuses it was a large family nine brothers and sisters and his father was a working man my father is a chemist mrs ramsay he keeps a shop he himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen often he went without a greatcoat in winter he could never return hospitality those were his parched stiff words at college he had to make things last twice the time other people did he smoked the cheapest tobacco shag the same the old men did in the quays he worked hard seven hours a day his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody they were walking on and mrs ramsay did not quite catch the meaning only the words here and there dissertation fellowship readership lectureship she could not follow the ugly academic jargon that rattled itself off so glibly but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch poor little man and why he came out instantly with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters and she would see to it that they did not laugh at him any more she would tell prue about it what he would have liked she supposed would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to ibsen with the ramsays he was an awful prig oh yes an insufferable bore for though they had reached the town now and were in the main street with carts grinding past on the cobbles still he went on talking about settlements and teaching and working men and helping our own class and lectures till she gathered that he had got back entire self confidence had recovered from the circus and was about and now again she liked him warmly to tell her but here the houses falling away on both sides they came out on the quay and the whole bay spread before them and mrs ramsay could not help exclaiming oh how beautiful for the great plateful of blue water was before her the hoary lighthouse distant austere in the midst and on the right as far as the eye could see fading and falling in soft low pleats the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them which always seemed to be running away into some moon country uninhabited of men that was the view she said stopping growing greyer eyed that her husband loved she paused a moment but now she said artists had come here there indeed only a few paces off stood one of them in panama hat and yellow boots seriously softly absorbedly for all that he was watched by ten little boys with an air of profound contentment on his round red face gazing and then when he had gazed dipping imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of green or pink since mr paunceforte had been there three years before all the pictures were like that she said green and grey with lemon coloured sailing boats and pink women on the beach but her grandmother own friends she said glancing discreetly as they passed took the greatest pains first they mixed their own colours and then they ground them and then they put damp cloths to keep them moist so mr tansley supposed she meant him to see that that man own picture was skimpy was that what one said the colours were not solid was that what one said under the influence of that extraordinary emotion which had been growing all the walk had begun in the garden when he had wanted to take her bag had increased in the town when he had wanted to tell her everything about himself he was coming to see himself and everything he had ever known gone crooked a little it was awfully strange there he stood in the parlour of the poky little house where she had taken him waiting for her while she went upstairs a moment to see a woman he heard her quick step above heard her voice cheerful then low looked at the mats tea caddies glass shades waited quite impatiently looked forward eagerly to the walk home determined to carry her bag then heard her come out shut a door say they must keep the windows open and the doors shut ask at the house for anything they wanted she must be talking to a child when suddenly in she came stood for a moment silent as if she had been pretending up there and for a moment let herself be now stood quite motionless for a moment against a picture of queen victoria wearing the blue ribbon of the garter when all at once he realised that it was this it was this she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen with stars in her eyes and veils in her hair with cyclamen and wild violets what nonsense was he thinking she was fifty at least she had eight children stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair he had hold of her bag good bye elsie she said and they walked up the street she holding her parasol erect and walking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner while for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride a man digging in a drain stopped digging and looked at her let his arm fall down and looked at her for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride felt the wind and the cyclamen and the violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman he had hold of her bag no going to the lighthouse james he said as trying in deference to mrs ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least odious little man thought mrs ramsay why go on saying that perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds singing she said compassionately smoothing the little boy own hair for her husband with his caustic saying that it would not be fine had dashed his spirits she could see this going to the lighthouse was a passion of his she saw and then as if her husband had not said enough with his caustic saying that it would not be fine tomorrow this odious little man went and rubbed it in all over again perhaps it will be fine tomorrow she said smoothing his hair all she could do now was to admire the refrigerator and turn the pages of the stores list in the hope that she might come upon something like a rake or a mowing machine which with its prongs and its handles would need the greatest skill and care in cutting out all these young men parodied her husband she reflected he said it would rain they said it would be a positive tornado but here as she turned the page suddenly her search for the picture of a rake or a mowing machine was interrupted the gruff murmur irregularly broken by the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her though she could not hear what was said as she sat in the window which opened on the terrace that the men were happily talking this sound which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her such as the tap of balls upon bats the sharp sudden bark now and then how is that how is that of the children playing cricket had ceased so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song murmured by nature i am guarding you i am your support but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand had no such kindly meaning but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat the measure of life made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea and warned her whose day had slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as a rainbow this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror they had ceased to talk that was the explanation falling in one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion was cool amused and even faintly malicious she concluded that poor charles tansley had been she would that was of little account to her if her husband required sacrifices and indeed he did she cheerfully offered up to him charles tansley who had snubbed her little boy one moment more with her head raised she listened as if she waited for some habitual sound some regular mechanical sound and then hearing something rhythmical half said half chanted beginning in the garden as her husband beat up and down the terrace something between a croak and a song she was soothed once more assured again that all was well and looking down at the book on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if james was very careful suddenly a loud cry as of a sleep walker half roused something about stormed at with shot and she will sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear made her turn apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him only lily briscoe she was glad to find and that did not matter but the sight of the girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her she was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for lily own picture lily own picture mrs ramsay smiled with her little chinese eyes and her puckered up face she would never marry one could not take her painting very seriously she was an independent little creature and mrs ramsay liked her for it so remembering her promise she bent her head indeed he almost knocked her easel over coming down upon her with his hands waving shouting out boldly we rode and well but mercifully he turned sharp and rode off to die gloriously she supposed upon the heights of balaclava never was anybody at once so ridiculous and so alarming but so long as he kept like that waving shouting she was safe he would not stand still and look at her picture and that was what lily briscoe could not have endured even while she looked at the mass at the line at the colour at mrs ramsay sitting in the window with james she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep up and suddenly she should find her picture looked at but now with all her senses quickened as they were looking straining till the colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes she was aware of someone coming out of the house coming towards her but somehow divined from the footfall william bankes so that though her brush quivered she did not as she would have done had it been mr tansley paul rayley minta doyle or practically anybody else turn her canvas upon the grass but let it stand william bankes stood beside her they had rooms in the village and so walking in walking out parting late on door mats had said little things about the soup about the children about one thing and another which made them allies so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way he was old enough to be her father too a botanist a widower smelling of soap very scrupulous and clean she just stood there he just stood there her shoes were excellent he observed they allowed the toes their natural expansion lodging in the same house with her he had noticed too how orderly she was up before breakfast and off to paint he believed alone poor presumably and without the complexion or the allurement of miss doyle certainly but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to that young lady now for instance when ramsay bore down on them shouting gesticulating miss briscoe he felt certain understood some one had blundered mr ramsay glared at them he glared at them without seeming to see them that did make them both vaguely uncomfortable together they had seen a thing they had not been meant to see they had encroached upon a privacy so lily thought it was probably an excuse of his for moving for getting out of earshot that made mr bankes almost immediately say something about its being chilly and suggested taking a stroll she would come yes but it was with difficulty that she took her eyes off her picture the jacmanna was bright violet the wall staring white she would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white since she saw them like that fashionable though it was since mr paunceforte own visit to see everything pale elegant semitransparent then beneath the colour there was the shape she could see it all so clearly so commandingly when she looked it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed it was in that moment own flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child such she often felt herself struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage to say but this is what i see this is what i see and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her and it was then too in that chill and windy way as she began to paint that there forced themselves upon her other things her own inadequacy her insignificance keeping house for her father off the brompton road and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself thank heaven she had always resisted so far at mrs ramsay own knee and say to her but what could one say to her I am in love with you no that was not true I am in love with this all waving her hand at the hedge at the house at the children it was absurd it was impossible so now she laid her brushes neatly in the box side by side and said to william bankes it suddenly gets cold the sun seems to give less heat she said looking about her for it was bright enough the grass still a soft deep green the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue but something moved flashed turned a silver wing in the air it was september after all the middle of september and past six in the evening so off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction past the tennis lawn past the pampas grass to that break in the thick hedge guarded by red hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever they came there regularly every evening drawn by some need it was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief first the pulse of colour flooded the bay with blue and the heart expanded with it and the body swam only the next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on the ruffled waves then up behind the great black rock almost every evening spurted irregularly so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came a fountain of white water and then while one waited for that one watched on the pale semicircular beach wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly a film of mother of pearl they both smiled standing there they both felt a common hilarity excited by the moving waves and then by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat which having sliced a curve in the bay stopped shivered let its sails drop down and then with a natural instinct to complete the picture after this swift movement both of them looked at the dunes far away and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness because the thing was completed partly and partly because distant views seem to outlast by a million years lily thought the gazer and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest looking at the far sand hills william bankes thought of ramsay thought of a road in westmorland thought of ramsay striding along a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air but this was suddenly interrupted william bankes remembered and this must refer to some actual incident by a hen straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks upon which ramsay stopping pointed his stick and said pretty pretty an odd illumination in to his heart bankes had thought it which showed his simplicity his sympathy with humble things but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased there on that stretch of road after that ramsay had married after that what with one thing and another the pulp had gone out of their friendship whose fault it was he could not say only after a time repetition had taken the place of newness it was to repeat that they met but in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained that his affection for ramsay had in no way diminished but there like the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century with the red fresh on his lips was his friendship in its acuteness and reality laid up across the bay among the sandhills he was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and shrunk for ramsay lived in a welter of children whereas bankes was childless and a widower he was anxious that lily briscoe should not disparage ramsay a great man in his own way yet should understand how things stood between them begun long years ago their friendship had petered out on a westmorland road where the hen spread her wings before her chicks after which ramsay had married and their paths lying different ways there had been certainly for no one own fault some tendency when they met to repeat yes that was it he finished he turned from the view and turning to walk back the other way up the drive mr bankes was alive to things which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in peat for instance cam the little girl ramsay own youngest daughter she was picking sweet alice on the bank she was wild and fierce she would not give a flower to the gentleman as the nursemaid told her no no no she would not she clenched her fist she stamped and mr bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship he must have dried and shrunk the ramsays were not rich and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all eight children to feed eight children on philosophy here was another of them jasper this time strolling past to have a shot at a bird he said nonchalantly swinging lily own hand like a pump handle as he passed which caused mr bankes to say bitterly how she was a favourite there was education now to be considered true mrs ramsay had something of her own perhaps let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those great fellows all well grown angular ruthless youngsters must require as for being sure which was which or in what order they came that was beyond him he called them privately after the kings and queens of england cam the wicked james the ruthless andrew the just prue the fair for prue would have beauty he thought how could she help it and andrew brains while he walked up the drive and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments for she was in love with them all in love with this world he weighed ramsay own case commiserated him envied him as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities they gave him something william bankes acknowledged that it would have been pleasant if cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder as over her father own to look at a picture of vesuvius in eruption but they had also his old friends could not but feel destroyed something what would a stranger think now what did this lily briscoe think could one help noticing that habits grew on him eccentricities weaknesses perhaps it was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did but that was too harsh a phrase could depend so much as he did upon people own praise oh but said lily think of his work whenever she thought of his work she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table it was andrew own doing she asked him what his father own books were about subject and object and the nature of reality andrew had said and when she said heavens she had no notion what that meant think of a kitchen table then he told her when you are not there so now she always saw when she thought of mr ramsay own work a scrubbed kitchen table it lodged now in the fork of a pear tree for they had reached the orchard and with a painful effort of concentration she focused her mind not upon the silver bossed bark of the tree or upon its fish shaped leaves but upon a phantom kitchen table one of those scrubbed board tables grained and knotted whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity which stuck there its four legs in air naturally if one own days were passed in this seeing of angular essences this reducing of lovely evenings with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four legged table and it was a mark of the finest minds to do so naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person mr bankes liked her for bidding him think of his work he had thought of it often and often times without number he had said ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are forty he had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was only five and twenty what came after was more or less amplification repetition but the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small he said pausing by the pear tree well brushed scrupulously exact exquisitely judicial suddenly as if the movement of his hand had released it the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him that was one sensation then up rose in a fume the essence of his being that was another she felt herself transfixed by the intensity of her perception it was his severity his goodness i respect you she addressed silently him in person in every atom you are not vain you are entirely impersonal you are finer than mr ramsay you are the finest human being that i know you have neither wife nor child without any sexual feeling she longed to cherish that loneliness you live for science involuntarily sections of potatoes rose before her eyes praise would be an insult to you generous pure hearted heroic man but simultaneously she remembered how he had brought a valet all the way up here objected to dogs on chairs would prose for hours until mr ramsay slammed out of the room about salt in vegetables and the iniquity of english cooks how then did it work out all this how did one judge people think of them how did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking and to those words what meaning attached after all standing now apparently transfixed by the pear tree impressions poured in upon her of those two men and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one own pencil and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting undeniable everlasting contradictory things so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity you have greatness she continued but mr ramsay has none of it he is petty selfish vain egotistical he is spoilt he is a tyrant he wears mrs ramsay to death but he has what you she addressed mr bankes have not a fiery unworldliness he knows nothing about trifles he loves dogs and his children he has eight mr bankes has none did he not come down in two coats the other night and let mrs ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin all of this danced up and down like a company of gnats each separate but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net danced up and down in lily own mind in and about the branches of the pear tree where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table symbol of her profound respect for mr ramsay own mind until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity she felt released a shot went off close at hand and there came flying from its fragments frightened effusive tumultuous a flock of starlings jasper said mr bankes they turned the way the starlings flew over the terrace following the scatter of swift flying birds in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into mr ramsay who boomed tragically at them some one had blundered his eyes glazed with emotion defiant with tragic intensity met theirs for a second and trembled on the verge of recognition but then raising his hand half way to his face as if to avert to brush off in an agony of peevish shame their normal gaze as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable as if he impressed upon them his own child like resentment of interruption yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed but in which he revelled he turned abruptly slammed his private door on them and lily briscoe and mr bankes looking uneasily up into the sky observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees and even if it is not fine tomorrow said mrs ramsay raising her eyes to glance at william bankes and lily briscoe as they passed it will be another day and now she said thinking that lily own charm was her chinese eyes aslant in her white puckered little face but it would take a clever man to see it and now stand up and let me measure your leg for they might go to the lighthouse after all and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg smiling for it was an admirable idea that had flashed upon her this very second william and lily should marry she took the heather mixture stocking with its criss cross of steel needles at the mouth of it and measured it against james own leg my dear stand still she said for in his jealousy not liking to serve as measuring block for the lighthouse keeper own little boy james fidgeted purposely and if he did that how could she see was it too long was it too short she asked she looked up what demon possessed him her youngest her cherished and saw the room saw the chairs thought them fearfully shabby their entrails as andrew said the other day were all over the floor but then what was the point she asked of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house with only one old woman to see to it positively dripped with wet never mind the rent was precisely twopence half penny the children loved it it did her husband good to be three thousand or if she must be accurate three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples and there was room for visitors mats camp beds crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose london life of service was done they did well enough here and a photograph or two and books books she thought grew of themselves she never had time to read them alas even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself for her whose wishes must be obeyed the happier helen of our days disgraceful to say she had never read them and croom on the mind and bates on the savage customs of polynesia my dear stand still she said neither of those could one send to the lighthouse at a certain moment she supposed the house would become so shabby that something must be done if they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them that would be something crabs she had to allow if andrew really wished to dissect them or if jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed one could not prevent it or rose own objects shells reeds stones for they were gifted her children but all in quite different ways and the result of it was she sighed taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling as she held the stocking against james own leg that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer the mat was fading the wall paper was flapping you could not tell any more that those were roses on it still if every door in a house is left perpetually open and no lockmaker in the whole of scotland can mend a bolt things must spoil what was the use of flinging a green cashemere shawl over the edge of a picture frame in two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup but it was the doors that annoyed her every door was left open she listened the drawing room door was open the hall door was open it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open and certainly the window on the landing was open for that she had opened herself that windows should be open and doors shut simple as it was could none of them remember it she would go into the maids bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens except for marie own the swiss girl who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air but then at home she had said the mountains are so beautiful she had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes the mountains are so beautiful her father was dying there mrs ramsay knew he was leaving them fatherless scolding and demonstrating how to make a bed how to open a window with hands that shut and spread like a frenchwoman own all had folded itself quietly about her when the girl spoke as after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple she had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said he had cancer of the throat at the recolection how she had stood there how the girl had said at home the mountains are so beautiful and there was no hope no hope whatever she had a spasm of irritation and speaking sharply said to james stand still do not be tiresome so that he knew instantly that her severity was real and straightened his leg and she measured it the stocking was too short by half an inch at least making allowance for the fact that sorley own little boy would be less well grown than james it is too short she said ever so much too short never did anybody look so sad bitter and black half way down in the darkness in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the depths perhaps a tear formed a tear fell the waters swayed this way and that received it and were at rest never did anybody look so sad but was it nothing but looks people said what was there behind it her beauty and splendour had he blown his brains out they asked had he died the week before they were married some other earlier lover of whom rumours reached one or was there nothing nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind and could do nothing to disturb for easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion of love foiled of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself she never spoke she was silent always she knew then she knew without having learnt her simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified her singleness of mind made her drop plumb like a stone alight exact as a bird gave her naturally this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which delighted eased sustained falsely perhaps nature has but little clay said mr bankes once much moved by her voice on the telephone though she was only telling him a fact about a train like that of which she moulded you he saw her at the end of the line greek blue eyed straight nosed how incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that the graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face yes he would catch the at euston but she is no more aware of her beauty than a child said mr bankes replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house and he thought of mrs ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls for always he thought there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face she clapped a deer stalker own hat on her head she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief so that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of one must remember the quivering thing the living thing they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them and work it into the picture or if one thought of her simply as a woman one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy she did not like admiration or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty and she wanted only to be like other people insignificant he did not know he did not know he must go to his work knitting her reddish brown hairy stocking with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame and the authenticated masterpiece by michael angelo mrs ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before raised his head and kissed her little boy on the forehead let us find another picture to cut out she said but what had happened some one had blundered starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time some one had blundered fixing her short sighted eyes upon her husband who was now bearing down upon her she gazed steadily until his closeness revealed to her the jingle mated itself in her head that something had happened some one had blundered but she could not for the life of her think what he shivered he quivered all his vanity all his satisfaction in his own splendour riding fell as a thunderbolt fierce as a hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death had been shattered destroyed stormed at by shot and she will boldly we rode and well flashed through the valley of death volleyed and thundered straight into lily briscoe and william bankes he quivered he shivered not for the world would she have spoken to him realising from the familiar signs his eyes averted and some curious gathering together of his person as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium that he was outraged and anguished she stroked james own head she transferred to him what she felt for her husband and as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the army and navy stores catalogue thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist and why should he not he had a splendid forehead then looking up as her husband passed her once more she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled domesticity triumphed custom crooned its soothing rhythm so that when stopping deliberately as his turn came round again at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle james own bare calf with a sprig of something she twitted him for having dispatched that poor young man charles tansley tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation he said james will have to write his dissertation one of these days he added ironically flicking his sprig hating his father james brushed away the tickling spray with which in a manner peculiar to him compound of severity and humour he teased his youngest son own bare leg she was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send to sorley own little boy tomorrow said mrs ramsay there was not the slightest possible chance that they could go to the lighthouse tomorrow mr ramsay snapped out irascibly how did he know she asked the wind often changed the extraordinary irrationality of her remark the folly of women own minds enraged him he had ridden through the valley of death been shattered and shivered and now she flew in the face of facts made his children hope what was utterly out of the question in effect told lies he stamped his foot on the stone step damn you he said but what had she said simply that it might be fine tomorrow so it might not with the barometer falling and the wind due west to pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people own feelings to rendthe thin veils of civilization so wantonly so brutally was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency that without replying dazed and blinded she bent her head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail the drench of dirty water bespatter her unrebuked there was nothing to be said he stood by her in silence very humbly at length he said that he would step over and ask the coastguards if she liked there was nobody whom she reverenced as she reverenced him she was quite ready to take his word for it she said only then they need not cut sandwiches that was all they came to her naturally since she was a woman all day long with this and that one wanting this another that the children were growing up she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions then he said damn you he said it must rain he said it will not rain and instantly a heaven of security opened before her there was nobody she reverenced more she was not good enough to tie his shoe strings she felt already ashamed of that petulance of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops mr ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son own bare legs once more and then as if he had her leave for it with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side he dived into the evening air which already thinner was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but as if in return restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day some one had blundered he said again striding off up and down the terrace but how extraordinarily his note had changed it was like the cuckoo in june he gets out of tune as if he were trying over tentatively seeking some phrase for a new mood and having only this at hand used it cracked though it was but it sounded ridiculous some one had blundered said like that almost as a question without any conviction melodiously mrs ramsay could not help smiling and soon sure enough walking up and down he hummed it dropped it fell silent he was safe he was restored to his privacy he stopped to light his pipe looked once at his wife and son in the window and as one raises one own eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm a tree a cluster of cottages as an illustration a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns fortified and satisfied so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind it was a splendid mind for if thought is like the keyboard of a piano divided into so many notes or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty six letters all in order then his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one firmly and accurately until it had reached say the letter q he reached q very few people in the whole of england ever reach q here stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums he saw but now far far away like children picking up shells divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived his wife and son together in the window they needed his protection he gave it them but after q what comes next after q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes but glimmers red in the distance z is only reached once by one man in a generation still if he could reach r it would be something here at least was q he dug his heels in at q q he was sure of q he could demonstrate if q then is q are here he knocked his pipe out with two or three resonant taps on the handle of the urn and proceeded then r he braced himself he clenched himself qualities that would have saved a ship own company exposed on a broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of water endurance and justice foresight devotion skill came to his help r is then what is r a shutter like the leathern eyelid of a lizard flickered over the intensity of his gaze and obscured the letter r in that flash of darkness he heard people saying he was a failure that r was beyond him he would never reach r on to r once more are qualities that in a desolate expedition across the icy solitudes of the polar region would have made him the leader the guide the counsellor whose temper neither sanguine nor despondent surveys with equanimity what is to be and faces it came to his help again are the lizard own eye flickered once more the veins on his forehead bulged the geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and displayed among its leaves he could see without wishing it that old that obvious distinction between the two classes of men on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who plodding and persevering repeat the whole alphabet in order twenty six letters in all from start to finish on the other the gifted the inspired who miraculously lump all the letters together in one flash the way of genius he had not genius he laid no claim to that but he had or might have had the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from a to z accurately in order meanwhile he stuck at q on then on to r feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who now that the snow has begun to fall and the mountain top is covered in mist knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes stole upon him paling the colour of his eyes giving him even in the two minutes of his turn on the terrace the bleached look of withered old age yet he would not die lying down he would find some crag of rock and there his eyes fixed on the storm trying to the end to pierce the darkness he would die standing he would never reach r he stood stock still by the urn with the geranium flowing over it how many men in a thousand million he asked himself reach z after all surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that and answer without treachery to the expedition behind him one perhaps one in a generation is he to be blamed then if he is not that one provided he has toiled honestly given to the best of his power and till he has no more left to give and his fame lasts how long it is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter his fame lasts perhaps two thousand years and what are two thousand years asked mr ramsay ironically staring at the hedge what indeed if you look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages the very stone one kicks with one own boot will outlast shakespeare his own little light would shine not very brightly for a year or two and would then be merged in some bigger light and that in a bigger still he looked into the hedge into the intricacy of the twigs who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of the stars if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow and square his shoulders so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post the fine figure of a soldier mr ramsay squared his shoulders and stood very upright by the urn who shall blame him if so standing for a moment he dwells upon fame upon search parties upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his bones finally who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition if having adventured to the uttermost and used his strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring if he wakes or not he now perceives by some pricking in his toes that he lives and does not on the whole object to live but requires sympathy and whisky and some one to tell the story of his suffering to at once who shall blame him who will not secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off and halts by the window and gazes at his wife and son who very distant at first gradually come closer and closer till lips and book and head are clearly before him though still lovely and unfamiliar from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the perishing of the stars and finally putting his pipe in his pocket and bending his magnificent head before her who will blame him if he does homage to the beauty of the world but his son hated him he hated him for coming up to them for stopping and looking down on them he hated him for interrupting them he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures for the magnificence of his head for his exactingness and egotism for there he stood commanding them to attend to him but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father own emotion which vibrating round them disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother by looking fixedly at the page he hoped to make him move on by pointing his finger at a word he hoped to recall his mother own attention which he knew angrily wavered instantly his father stopped but no nothing would make mr ramsay move on there he stood demanding sympathy mrs ramsay who had been sitting loosely folding her son in her arm braced herself and half turning seemed to raise herself with an effort and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy a column of spray looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force burning and illuminating quietly though she sat taking up her stocking again and into this delicious fecundity this fountain and spray of life the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself like a beak of brass barren and bare he wanted sympathy he was a failure he said mrs ramsay flashed her needles mr ramsay repeated never taking his eyes from her face that he was a failure she blew the words back at him charles tansley she said but he must have more than that it was sympathy he wanted to be assured of his genius first of all and then to be taken within the circle of life warmed and soothed to have his senses restored to him his barrenness made furtile and all the rooms of the house made full of life the drawing room behind the drawing room the kitchen above the kitchen the bedrooms and beyond them the nurseries they must be furnished they must be filled with life charles tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time she said but he must have more than that he must have sympathy he must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life was needed not only here but all over the world flashing her needles confident upright she created drawing room and kitchen set them all aglow bade him take his ease there go in and out enjoy himself she laughed she knitted standing between her knees very stiff james felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass the arid scimitar of the male which smote mercilessly again and again demanding sympathy he was a failure he repeated well look then feel then flashing her needles glancing round about her out of the window into the room at james himself she assured him beyond a shadow of a doubt by her laugh her poise her competence as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child that it was real the house was full the garden blowing if he put implicit faith in her nothing should hurt him however deep he buried himself or climed high not for a second should he find himself without her so boasting of her capacity to surround and protect there was scarcely a she will of herself left for her to know herself by all was so lavished and spent and james as he stood stiff between her knees felt her rise in a rosy flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass the arid scimitar of his father the egotistical man plunged and smote demanding sympathy filled with her words like a child who drops off satisfied he said at last looking at her with humble gratitude restored renewed that he would take a turn he would watch the children playing cricket he went immediately mrs ramsey seemed to fold herself together one petal closed in another and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself so that she had only strength enough to move her finger in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion across the page of grimm own fairy story while there throbbed through her like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat the rapture of successful creation every throb of this pulse seemed as he walked away to enclose her and her husband and to give to each that solace which two different notes one high one low struck together seem to give each other as they combine yet as the resonance died and she turned to the fairy tale again mrs ramsey felt not only exhausted in body afterwards not at the time she always felt this but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin not that as she read aloud the story of the fisherman own wife she knew precisely what it came from nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully ominously a wave fall how it came from this she did not like even for a second to feel finer than her husband and further could not bear not being entirely sure when she spoke to him of the truth of what she said universities and people wanting him lectures and books and their being of the highest importance all that she did not doubt for a moment but it was their relation and his coming to her like that openly so that any one could see that discomposed her for then people said he depended on her when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important and what she gave the world in comparison with what he gave negligable but then again it was the other thing too not being able to tell him the truth being afraid for instance about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be fifty pounds perhaps to mend it and then about his books to be afraid that he might guess what she a little suspected that his last book was not quite his best book she gathered that from william bankes and then to hide small daily things and the children seeing it and the burden it laid on them all this diminished the entire joy the pure joy of the two notes sounding together and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness a shadow was on the page she looked up it was augustus carmichael shuffling past precisely now at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships that the most perfect was flawed and could not bear the examination which loving her husband with her instinct for truth she turned upon it when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness and impeded in her proper function by these lies these exaggerations it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation that mr carmichael shuffled past in his yellow slippers and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out as he passed going indoors mr carmichael he said nothing he took opium the children said he had stained his beard yellow with it perhaps what was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy came to them every year as an escape and yet every year she felt the same thing he did not trust her she said i am going to the town shall i get you stamps paper tobacco and she felt him wince he did not trust her it was his wife own doing she remembered that iniquity of his wife own towards him which had made her turn to steel and adamant there in the horrible little room in st john own wood when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house he was unkempt he dropped things on his coat he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do and she turned him out of the room she said in her odious way now mrs ramsay and i want to have a little talk together and mrs ramsay could see as if before her eyes the innumerable miseries of his life had he money enough to buy tobacco did he have to ask her for it half a crown eighteenpence oh she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer and always now why she could not guess except that it came probably from that woman somehow he shrank from her he never told her anything but what more could she have done there was a sunny room given up to him the children were good to him never did she show a sign of not wanting him she went out of her way indeed to be friendly do you want stamps do you want tobacco here is a book you might like and so on and after all after all here insensibly she drew herself together physically the sense of her own beauty becoming as it did so seldom present to her after all she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her for instance george manning mr wallace famous as they were they would come to her of an evening quietly and talk alone over her fire she bore about with her she could not help knowing it the torch of her beauty she carried it erect into any room that she entered and after all veil it as she might and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her her beauty was apparent she had been admired she had been loved she had entered rooms where mourners sat tears had flown in her presence men and women too letting go to the multiplicity of things had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity it injured her that he should shrink it hurt her and yet not cleanly not rightly that was what she minded coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband the sense she had now when mr carmichael shuffled past just nodding to her question with a book beneath his arm in his yellow slippers that she was suspected and that all this desire of hers to give to help was vanity for her own self satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help to give that people might say of her o mrs ramsay dear mrs ramsay mrs ramsay of course and need her and send for her and admire her was it not secretly this that she wanted and therefore when mr carmichael shrank away from her as he did at this moment making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her and of human relations how flawed they are how despicable how self seeking at their best shabby and worn out and not presumably her cheeks were hollow her hair was white any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy she had better devote her mind to the story of the fisherman and his wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness none of her children was as sensitive as he was her son james the man own heart grew heavy she read aloud and he would not go he said to himself it is not right and yet he went and when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark blue and grey and thick and no longer so green and yellow but it was still quiet and he stood there and said mrs ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment to stop why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing cricket but he did not speak he looked he nodded he approved he went on he slipped seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause signified some conclusion seeing his wife and child seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought and bore written up among their leaves as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading he slipped seeing all this smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in the times about the number of americans who visit shakespeare own house every year if shakespeare had never existed he asked would the world have differed much from what it is today does the progress of civilization depend upon great men is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the pharaohs is the lot of the average human being however he asked himself the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization possibly not possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class the liftman in the tube is an eternal necessity the thought was distasteful to him he tossed his head to avoid it he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts he would argue that the world exists for the average human being that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life they do not express it nor is shakespeare necessary to it not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge all this would have to be dished up for the young men at cardiff next month he thought here on his terrace he was merely foraging and picnicking he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood it was all familiar this turning that stile that cut across the fields hours he would spend thus with his pipe of an evening thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there the life of this statesman here with poems and with anecdotes with figures too this thinker that soldier all very brisk and clear but at length the lane the field the common the fruitful nut tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always tied his horse to a tree and proceeded on foot alone he reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath it was his fate his peculiarity whether he wished it or not to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away and there to stand like a desolate sea bird alone it was his power his gift suddenly to she would all superfluities to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer even physically yet lost none of his intensity of mind and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on that was his fate his gift but having thrown away when he dismounted all gestures and fripperies all trophies of nuts and roses and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision and it was in this guise that he inspired in william bankes intermittently and in charles tansley obsequiously and in his wife now when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn profoundly reverence and pity and gratitude too as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone but the father of eight children has no choice muttering half aloud so he broke off turned sighed raised his eyes sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy filled his pipe he turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on which had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over to deprecate it as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes it was true he was for the most part happy he had his wife he had his children he had promised in six weeks time to talk some nonsense to the young men of cardiff about locke hume berkeley and the causes of the french revolution but this and his pleasure in it his glory in the phrases he made in the ardour of youth in his wife own beauty in the tributes that reached him from swansea cardiff exeter southampton kidderminster oxford cambridge all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase talking nonsense because in effect he had not done the thing he might have done it was a disguise it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings who could not say this is what i like this is what i am and rather pitiable and distasteful to william bankes and lily briscoe who wondered why such concealments should be necessary why he needed always praise why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time teaching and preaching is beyond human power lily suspected she was putting away her things if you are exalted you must somehow come a cropper mrs ramsay gave him what he asked too easily then the change must be so upsetting lily said he comes in from his books and finds us all playing games and talking nonsense imagine what a change from the things he thinks about she said he was bearing down upon them now he stopped dead and stood looking in silence at the sea now he had turned away again yes mr bankes said watching him go it was a thousand pities lily had said something about his frightening her he changed from one mood to another so suddenly yes said mr bankes it was a thousand pities that ramsay could not behave a little more like other people for he liked lily briscoe he could discuss ramsay with her quite openly it was for that reason he said that the young do not read carlyle a crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold why should he preach to us was what mr bankes understood that young people said nowadays it was a thousand pities if you thought as he did that carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind lily was ashamed to say that she had not read carlyle since she was at school but in her opinion one liked mr ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end it was not that she minded for who could be deceived by him he asked you quite openly to flatter him to admire him his little dodges deceived nobody what she disliked was his narrowness his blindness she said looking after him a bit of a hypocrite mr bankes suggested looking too at mr ramsay own back for was he not thinking of his friendship and of cam refusing to give him a flower and of all those boys and girls and his own house full of comfort but since his wife own death quiet rather of course he had his work all the same he rather wished lily to agree that ramsay was as he said a bit of a hypocrite lily briscoe went on putting away her brushes looking up looking down looking up there he was mr ramsay advancing towards them swinging careless oblivious remote a bit of a hypocrite she repeated oh no the most sincere of men the truest here he was the best but looking down she thought he is absorbed in himself he is tyrannical he is unjust and kept looking down purposely for only so could she keep steady staying with the ramsays directly one looked up and saw them what she called being in love flooded them they became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love the sky stuck to them the birds sang through them and what was even more exciting she felt too as she saw mr ramsay bearing down and retreating and mrs ramsay sitting with james in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending how life from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it there with a dash on the beach mr bankes expected her to answer and she was about to say something criticizing mrs ramsay how she was alarming too in her way high handed or words to that effect when mr bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture for such it was considering his age turned sixty and his cleanliness and his impersonality and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him for him to gaze as lily saw him gazing at mrs ramsay was a rapture equivalent lily felt to the loves of dozens of young men and perhaps mrs ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men it was love she thought pretending to move her canvas distilled and filtered love that never attempted to clutch its object but like the love which mathematicians bear their symbols or poets their phrases was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain so it was indeed the world by all means should have shared it could mr bankes have said why that woman pleased him so why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem so that he rested in contemplation of it and felt as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants that barbarity was tamed the reign of chaos subdued such a rapture for by what other name could one call it made lily briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say it was nothing of importance something about mrs ramsay it paled beside this rapture this silent stare for which she felt intense gratitude for nothing so solaced her eased her of the perplexity of life and miraculously raised its burdens as this sublime power this heavenly gift and one would no more disturb it while it lasted than break up the shaft of sunlight lying level across the floor that people should love like this that mr bankes should feel this for mrs ramsey she glanced at him musing was helpful was exalting she wiped one brush after another upon a piece of old rag menially on purpose she took shelter from the reverence which covered all women she felt herself praised let him gaze she would steal a look at her picture she could have wept it was bad it was bad it was infinitely bad she could have done it differently of course the colour could have been thinned and faded the shapes etherealised that was how paunceforte would have seen it but then she did not see it like that she saw the colour burning on a framework of steel the light of a butterfly own wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained and it would never be seen never be hung even and there was mr tansley whispering in her ear women cannot paint women cannot write she now remembered what she had been going to say about mrs ramsay she did not know how she would have put it but it would have been something critical she had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness looking along the level of mr bankes own glance at her she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped they could only seek shelter under the shade which mr bankes extended over them both looking along his beam she added to it her different ray thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people bowed over her book the best perhaps but also different too from the perfect shape which one saw there but why different and how different she asked herself scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now yet she vowed she would inspire them force them to move flow do her bidding tomorrow how did she differ what was the spirit in her the essential thing by which had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa you would have known it from its twisted finger hers indisputably she was like a bird for speed an arrow for directness she was willful she was commanding of course lily reminded herself i am thinking of her relations with women and i am much younger an insignificant person living off the brompton road she opened bedroom windows she shut doors so she tried to start the tune of mrs ramsay in her head arriving late at night with a light tap on one own bedroom door wrapped in an old fur coat for the setting of her beauty was always that hasty but apt she would enact again whatever it might be charles tansley losing his umbrella mr carmichael snuffling and sniffing mr bankes saying the vegetable salts are lost all this she would adroitly shape even maliciously twist and moving over to the window in pretence that she must go it was dawn she could see the sun rising half turn back more intimately but still always laughing insist that she must minta must they all must marry since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her but mrs ramsay cared not a fig for her painting or triumphs won by her probably mrs ramsay had had her share of those and here she saddened darkened and came back to her chair there could be no disputing this an unmarried woman she lightly took her hand for a moment an unmarried woman has missed the best of life the house seemed full of children sleeping and mrs ramsay listening shaded lights and regular breathing oh but lily would say there was her father her home even had she dared to say it her painting but all this seemed so little so virginal against the other yet as the night wore on and white lights parted the curtains and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law plead for it she liked to be alone she liked to be herself she was not made for that and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth and confront mrs ramsay own simple certainty and she was childlike now that her dear lily her little brisk was a fool then she remembered she had laid her head on mrs ramsay own lap and laughed and laughed and laughed laughed almost hysterically at the thought of mrs ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand there she sat simple serious she had recovered her sense of her now this was the glove own twisted finger but into what sanctuary had one penetrated lily briscoe had looked up at last and there was mrs ramsay unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter still presiding but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished and in its stead something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover the little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon was it wisdom was it knowledge was it once more the deceptiveness of beauty so that all one own perceptions half way to truth were tangled in a golden mesh or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly lily briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all every one could not be as helter skelter hand to mouth as she was but if they knew could they tell one what they knew sitting on the floor with her arms round mrs ramsay own knees close as she could get smiling to think that mrs ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was physically touching her were stood like the treasures in the tombs of kings tablets bearing sacred inscriptions which if one could spell them out would teach one everything but they would never be offered openly never made public what art was there known to love or cunning by which one pressed through into those secret chambers what device for becoming like waters poured into one jar inextricably the same one with the object one adored could the body achieve or the mind subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain or the heart could loving as people called it make her and mrs ramsay one for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired not inscriptions on tablets nothing that could be written in any language known to men but intimacy itself which is knowledge she had thought leaning her head on mrs ramsay own knee nothing happened nothing nothing as she leant her head against mrs ramsay own knee and yet she knew knowledge and wisdom were stored up in mrs ramsay own heart how then she had asked herself did one know one thing or another thing about people sealed as they were only like a bee drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste one haunted the dome shaped hive ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings the hives which were people mrs ramsay rose lily rose mrs ramsay went for days there hung about her as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of more vividly than anything she said the sound of murmuring and as she sat in the wicker arm chair in the drawing room window she wore to lily own eyes an august shape the shape of a dome this ray passed level with mr bankes own ray straight to mrs ramsay sitting reading there with james at her knee but now while she still looked mr bankes had done he had put on his spectacles he had stepped back he had raised his hand he had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes when lily rousing herself saw what he was at and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it she would have snatched her picture off the easel but she said to herself one must she braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture one must she said one must and if it must be seen mr bankes was less alarming than another but that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty three years the deposit of each day own living mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those days was an agony at the same time it was immensely exciting nothing could be cooler and quieter taking out a pen knife mr bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle what did she wish to indicate by the triangular purple shape just there he asked it was mrs ramsay reading to james she said she knew his objection that no one could tell it for a human shape but she had made no attempt at likeness she said for what reason had she introduced them then he asked why indeed except that if there in that corner it was bright here in this she felt the need of darkness simple obvious commonplace as it was mr bankes was interested mother and child then objects of universal veneration and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty might be reduced he pondered to a purple shadow without irreverence but the picture was not of them she said or not in his sense there were other senses too in which one might reverence them by a shadow here and a light there for instance her tribute took that form if as she vaguely supposed a picture must be a tribute a mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence a light here required a shadow there he considered he was interested he took it scientifically in complete good faith the truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side he explained the largest picture in his drawing room which painters had praised and valued at a higher price than he had given for it was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the kennet he had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the kennet he said lily must come and see that picture he said but now he turned with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas the question being one of the relations of masses of lights and shadows which to be honest he had never considered before he would like to have it explained what then did she wish to make of it and he indicated the scene before them she looked she could not show him what she wished to make of it could not see it even herself without a brush in her hand she took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent minded manner subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children her picture it was a question she remembered how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left she might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object james perhaps so but the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken she stopped she did not want to bore him she took the canvas lightly off the easel but it had been seen it had been taken from her this man had shared with her something profoundly intimate and thanking mr ramsay for it and mrs ramsay for it and the hour and the place crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody the strangest feeling in the world and the most exhilarating she nicked the catch of her paint box to more firmly than was necessary and the nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint box the lawn mr bankes and that wild villain cam dashing past for cam grazed the easel by an inch she would not stop for mr bankes and lily briscoe though mr bankes who would have liked a daughter of his own held out his hand she would not stop for her father whom she grazed also by an inch nor for her mother who called cam i want you a moment as she dashed past she was off like a bird bullet or arrow impelled by what desire shot by whom at what directed who could say what what mrs ramsay pondered watching her it might be a vision of a she will of a wheelbarrow of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge or it might be the glory of speed no one knew but when mrs ramsay called cam a second time the projectile dropped in mid career and cam came lagging back pulling a leaf by the way to her mother what was she dreaming about mrs ramsay wondered seeing her engrossed as she stood there with some thought of her own so that she had to repeat the message twice ask mildred if andrew miss doyle and mr rayley have come back the words seemed to be dropped into a well where if the waters were clear they were also so extraordinarily distorting that even as they descended one saw them twisting about to make heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child own mind what message would cam give the cook mrs ramsay wondered and indeed it was only by waiting patiently and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks drinking soup out of a basin that mrs ramsay at last prompted that parrot like instinct which had picked up mildred own words quite accurately and could now produce them if one waited in a colourless singsong shifting from foot to foot cam repeated the words no they have not and I have told ellen to clear away tea minta doyle and paul rayley had not come back then that could only mean mrs ramsay thought one thing she must accept him or she must refuse him this going off after luncheon for a walk even though andrew was with them what could it mean except that she had decided rightly mrs ramsay thought and she was very very fond of minta to accept that good fellow who might not be brilliant but then thought mrs ramsay realising that james was tugging at her to make her go on reading aloud the fisherman and his wife she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations charles tansley for instance anyhow it must have happened one way or the other by now but she read next morning the wife awoke first and it was just daybreak and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her her husband was still stretching himself but how could minta say now that she would not have him not if she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alone for andrew would be off after his crabs but possibly nancy was with them she tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after lunch there they stood looking at the sky wondering about the weather and she had said thinking partly to cover their shyness partly to encourage them to be off for her sympathies were with paul there is not a cloud anywhere within miles at which she could feel little charles tansley who had followed them out snigger but she did it on purpose whether nancy was there or not she could not be certain looking from one to the other in her mind own eye she read on ah wife said the man why should we be king i do not want to be king well said the wife if you will not be king i will go to the flounder for i will be king come in or go out cam she said knowing that cam was attracted only by the word flounder and that in a moment she would fidget and fight with james as usual cam shot off mrs ramsay went on reading relieved for she and james shared the same tastes and were comfortable together and when he came to the sea it was quite dark grey and the water heaved up from below and smelt putrid then he went and stood by it and said flounder flounder in the sea come i pray thee here to me for my wife good ilsabil wills not as I would have her will well what does she want then said the flounder and where were they now mrs ramsay wondered reading and thinking quite easily both at the same time for the story of the fisherman and his wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody and when should she be told if nothing happened she would have to speak seriously to minta for she could not go trapesing about all over the country even if nancy were with them she tried again unsuccessfully to visualize their backs going down the path and to count them she was responsible to minta own parents the owl and the poker her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read the owl and the poker yes they would be annoyed if they heard and they were certain to hear that minta staying with the ramsays had been seen etcetera etcetera etcetera he wore a wig in the house of commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs she repeated fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which coming back from some party she had made to amuse her husband dear dear mrs ramsay said to herself how did they produce this incongruous daughter this tomboy minta with a hole in her stocking how did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust pan the sand that the parrot had scattered and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits interesting perhaps but limited after all of that bird naturally one had asked her to lunch tea dinner finally to stay with them up at finlay which had resulted in some friction with the owl her mother and more calling and more conversation and more sand and really at the end of it she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime so she had said to her husband that night coming back from the party however minta came yes she came mrs ramsay thought suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought and disengaging it found it to be this a woman had once accused her of robbing her of her daughter own affections something mrs doyle had said made her remember that charge again wishing to dominate wishing to interfere making people do what she wished that was the charge against her and she thought it most unjust how could she help being like that to look at no one could accuse her of taking pains to impress she was often ashamed of her own shabbiness nor was she domineering nor was she tyrannical it was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy about things like that she did feel passionately and would if she had the chance have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see no hospital on the whole island it was a disgrace milk delivered at your door in london positively brown with dirt it should be made illegal a model dairy and a hospital up here those two things she would have liked to do herself but how with all these children when they were older then perhaps she would have time when they were all at school oh but she never wanted james to grow a day older or cam either these two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were demons of wickedness angels of delight never to see them grow up into long legged monsters nothing made up up for the loss when she read just now to james and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets and his eyes darkened she thought why should they grow up and lose all that he was the most gifted the most sensitive of her children but all she thought were full of promise prue a perfect angel with the others and sometimes now at night especially she took one own breath away with her beauty andrew even her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary and nancy and roger they were both wild creatures now scampering about over the country all day long as for rose her mouth was too big but she had a wonderful gift with her hands if they had charades rose made the dresses made everything liked best arranging tables flowers anything she did not like it that jasper should shoot birds but it was only a stage they all went through stages why she asked pressing her chin on james own head should they grow up so fast why should they go to school she would have liked always to have had a baby she was happiest carrying one in her arms then people might say she was tyrannical domineering masterful if they chose she did not mind and touching his hair with her lips she thought he will never be so happy again but stopped herself remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that still it was true they were happier now than they would ever be again a tenpenny tea set made cam happy for days she heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke they came bustling along the passage then the door sprang open and in they came fresh as roses staring wide awake as if this coming into the dining room after breakfast which they did every day of their lives was a positive event to them and so on with one thing after another all day long until she went up to say good night to them and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish something they had heard something they had picked up in the garden they all had their little treasures and so she went down and said to her husband why must they grow up and lose it all never will they be so happy again and he was angry why take such a gloomy view of life he said it is not sensible for it was odd and she believed it to be true that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier more hopeful on the whole than she was less exposed to human worries perhaps that was it he had always his work to fall back on not that she herself was pessimistic as he accused her of being only she thought life and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes her fifty years there it was before her life life she thought but she did not finish her thought she took a look at life for she had a clear sense of it there something real something private which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband a sort of transaction went on between them in which she was on one side and life was on another and she was always trying to get the better of it as it was of her and sometimes they parleyed when she sat alone there were she remembered great reconciliation scenes but for the most part oddly enough she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible hostile and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance there were eternal problems suffering death the poor there was always a woman dying of cancer even here and yet she had said to all these children you shall go through it all to eight people she had said relentlessly that and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds for that reason knowing what was before them love and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places she had often the feeling why must they grow up and lose it all and then she said to herself brandishing her sword at life nonsense they will be perfectly happy and here she was she reflected feeling life rather sinister again making minta marry paul rayley because whatever she might feel about her own transaction she had had experiences which need not happen to every one she did not name them to herself she was driven on too quickly she knew almost as if it were an escape for her too to say that people must marry people must have children was she wrong in this she asked herself reviewing her conduct for the past week or two and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon minta who was only twenty four to make up her mind she was uneasy had she not laughed about it was she not forgetting again how strongly she influenced people marriage needed oh all sorts of qualities the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds one she need not name it that was essential the thing she had with her husband had they that then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman she read but outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet houses and trees toppled over the mountains trembled rocks rolled into the sea the sky was pitch black and it thundered and lightened and the sea came in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains and all with white foam at the top she turned the page there were only a few lines more so that she would finish the story though it was past bed time it was getting late the light in the garden told her that and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety what it was about she could not think at first then she remembered paul and minta and andrew had not come back she summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door standing looking up into the sky andrew had his net and basket that meant he was going to catch crabs and things that meant he would climb out on to a rock he would be cut off or coming back single file on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might slip he would roll and then crash it was growing quite dark but she did not let her voice change in the least as she finished the story and added shutting the book and speaking the last words as if she had made them up herself looking into james own eyes and there they are living still at this very time and that is the end she said and she saw in his eyes as the interest of the story died away in them something else take its place something wondering pale like the reflection of a light which at once made him gaze and marvel turning she looked across the bay and there sure enough coming regularly across the waves first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke was the light of the lighthouse it had been lit in a moment he would ask her are we going to the lighthouse and she would have to say no not tomorrow your father says not happily mildred came in to fetch them and the bustle distracted them but he kept looking back over his shoulder as mildred carried him out and she was certain that he was thinking we are not going to the lighthouse tomorrow and she thought he will remember that all his life no she thought putting together some of the pictures he had cut out a refrigerator a mowing machine a gentleman in evening dress children never forget for this reason it was so important what one said and what one did and it was a relief when they went to bed for now she need not think about anybody she could be herself by herself and that was what now she often felt the need of to think well not even to think to be silent to be alone all the being and the doing expansive glittering vocal evaporated and one shrunk with a sense of solemnity to being oneself a wedge shaped core of darkness something invisible to others although she continued to knit and sat upright it was thus that she felt herself and this self having she would its attachments was free for the strangest adventures when life sank down for a moment the range of experience seemed limitless and to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources she supposed one after another she lily augustus carmichael must feel our apparitions the things you know us by are simply childish beneath it is all dark it is all spreading it is unfathomably deep but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by her horizon seemed to her limitless there were all the places she had not seen the indian plains she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in rome this core of darkness could go anywhere for no one saw it they could not stop it she thought exulting there was freedom there was peace there was most welcome of all a summoning together a resting on a platform of stability not as oneself did one find rest ever in her experience she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles but as a wedge of darkness losing personality one lost the fret the hurry the stir and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace this rest this eternity and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the lighthouse the long steady stroke the last of the three which was her stroke for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw and this thing the long steady stroke was her stroke often she found herself sitting and looking sitting and looking with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at that light for example and it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that children do not forget children do not forget which she would repeat and begin adding to it it will end it will end she said it will come it will come when suddenly she added we are in the hands of the lord but instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that who had said it not she she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean she looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart purifying out of existence that lie any lie she praised herself in praising the light without vanity for she was stern she was searching she was beautiful like that light it was odd she thought how if one was alone one leant to inanimate things trees streams flowers felt they expressed one felt they became one felt they knew one in a sense were one felt an irrational tenderness thus she looked at that long steady light as for oneself there rose and she looked and looked with her needles suspended there curled up off the floor of the mind rose from the lake of one own being a mist a bride to meet her lover what brought her to say that we are in the hands of the lord she wondered the insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her annoyed her she returned to her knitting again how could any lord have made this world she asked with her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason order justice but suffering death the poor there was no treachery too base for the world to commit she knew that no happiness lasted she knew that she knitted with firm composure slightly pursing her lips and without being aware of it so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed though he was chuckling at the thought that hume the philosopher grown enormously fat had stuck in a bog he could not help noting as he passed the sternness at the heart of her beauty it saddened him and her remoteness pained him and he felt as he passed that he could not protect her and when he reached the hedge he was sad he could do nothing to help her he must stand by and watch her indeed the infernal truth was he made things worse for her he was irritable he was touchy he had lost his temper over the lighthouse he looked into the hedge into its intricacy its darkness always mrs ramsay felt one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end some sound some sight she listened but it was all very still cricket was over the children were in their baths there was only the sound of the sea she stopped knitting she held the long reddish brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment she saw the light again with some irony in her interrogation for when one woke at all one own relations changed she looked at the steady light the pitiless the remorseless which was so much her yet so little her which had her at its beck and call she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed stroking the floor but for all that she thought watching it with fascination hypnotised as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight she had known happiness exquisite happiness intense happiness and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly as daylight faded and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt it is enough it is enough he turned and saw her ah she was lovely lovelier now than ever he thought but he could not speak to her he could not interrupt her he wanted urgently to speak to her now that james was gone and she was alone at last but he resolved no he would not interrupt her she was aloof from him now in her beauty in her sadness he would let her be and he passed her without a word though it hurt him that she should look so distant and he could not reach her he could do nothing to help her and again he would have passed her without a word had she not at that very moment given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame and gone to him for he wished she knew to protect her she folded the green shawl about her shoulders she took his arm his beauty was so great she said beginning to speak of kennedy the gardener at once he was so awfully handsome that she could not dismiss him there was a ladder against the greenhouse and little lumps of putty stuck about for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse yes but as she strolled along with her husband she felt that that particular source of worry had been placed she had it on the tip of her tongue to say as they strolled it will cost fifty pounds but instead for her heart failed her about money she talked about jasper shooting birds and he said at once soothing her instantly that it was natural in a boy and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long her husband was so sensible so just and so she said yes all children go through stages and began considering the dahlias in the big bed and wondering what about next year own flowers and had he heard the children own nickname for charles tansley she asked the atheist they called him the little atheist he is not a polished specimen said mr ramsay far from it said mrs ramsay she supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices mrs ramsay said wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs did they plant them oh he has his dissertation to write said mr ramsay she knew all about that said mrs ramsay he talked of nothing else it was about the influence of somebody upon something well it is all he has to count on said mr ramsay pray heaven he will not fall in love with prue said mrs ramsay he would disinherit her if she married him said mr ramsay he did not look at the flowers which his wife was considering but at a spot about a foot or so above them there was no harm in him he added and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in england who admired his when he choked it back he would not bother her again about his books these flowers seemed creditable mr ramsay said lowering his gaze and noticing something red something brown yes but then these she had put in with her own hands said mrs ramsay the question was what happened if she sent bulbs down did kennedy plant them it was his incurable laziness she added moving on if she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand he did sometimes do a stroke of work so they strolled along towards the red hot pokers you are teaching your daughters to exaggerate said mr ramsay reproving her her aunt camilla was far worse than she was mrs ramsay remarked nobody ever held up your aunt camilla as a model of virtue that I am aware of said mr ramsay she was the most beautiful woman i ever saw said mrs ramsay somebody else was that said mr ramsay prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was said mrs ramsay he saw no trace of it said mr ramsay well then look tonight said mrs ramsay they paused he wished andrew could be induced to work harder he would lose every chance of a scholarship if he did not oh scholarships she said mr ramsay thought her foolish for saying that about a serious thing like a scholarship he should be very proud of andrew if he got a scholarship he said she would be just as proud of him if he did not she answered they disagreed always about this but it did not matter she liked him to believe in scholarships and he liked her to be proud of andrew whatever he did suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs was not it late she asked they had not come home yet he flicked his watch carelessly open but it was only just past seven he held his watch open for a moment deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace to begin with it was not reasonable to be so nervous andrew could look after himself then he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now here he became uncomfortable as if he were breaking into that solitude that aloofness that remoteness of hers but she pressed him what had he wanted to tell her she asked thinking it was about going to the lighthouse that he was sorry he had said damn you but no he did not like to see her look so sad he said only wool gathering she protested flushing a little they both felt uncomfortable as if they did not know whether to go on or go back she had been reading fairy tales to james she said no they could not share that they could not say that they had reached the gap between the two clumps of red hot pokers and there was the lighthouse again but she would not let herself look at it had she known that he was looking at her she thought she would not have let herself sit there thinking she disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking so she looked over her shoulder at the town the lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind and all the poverty all the suffering had turned to that mrs ramsay thought the lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk well if he could not share her thoughts mr ramsay said to himself he would be off then on his own he wanted to go on thinking telling himself the story how hume was stuck in a bog he wanted to laugh but first it was nonsense to be anxious about andrew when he was andrew own age he used to walk about the country all day long with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him or thought that he had fallen over a cliff he said aloud he thought he would be off for a day own walk if the weather held he had had about enough of bankes and of carmichael he would like a little solitude yes she said it annoyed him that she did not protest she knew that he would never do it he was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket she worried about the boys but not about him years ago before he had married he thought looking across the bay as they stood between the clumps of red hot pokers he had walked all day he had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house he had worked ten hours at a stretch an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire that was the country he liked best over there those sandhills dwindling away into darkness one could walk all day without meeting a soul there was not a house scarcely not a single village for miles on end one could worry things out alone there were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time the seals sat up and looked at you it sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there alone he broke off sighing he had no right the father of eight children he reminded himself and he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered andrew would be a better man than he had been prue would be a beauty her mother said they would stem the flood a bit that was a good bit of work on the whole his eight children they showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely for on an evening like this he thought looking at the land dwindling away the little island seemed pathetically small half swallowed up in the sea poor little place he murmured with a sigh she heard him he said the most melancholy things but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual all this phrase making was a game she thought for if she had said half what he said she would have blown her brains out by now it annoyed her this phrase making and she said to him in a matter of fact way that it was a perfectly lovely evening and what was he groaning about she asked half laughing half complaining for she guessed what he was thinking he would have written better books if he had not married he was not complaining he said she knew that he did not complain she knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of and he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that brought the tears to her eyes and quickly he dropped it they turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver green spear like plants grew arm in arm his arm was almost like a young man own arm mrs ramsay thought thin and hard and she thought with delight how strong he still was though he was over sixty and how untamed and optimistic and how strange it was that being convinced as he was of all sorts of horrors seemed not to depress him but to cheer him was it not odd she reflected indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people born blind deaf and dumb to the ordinary things but to the extraordinary things with an eye like an eagle own his understanding often astonished her but did he notice the flowers no did he notice the view no did he even notice his own daughter own beauty or whether there was pudding on his plate or roast beef he would sit at table with them like a person in a dream and his habit of talking aloud or saying poetry aloud was growing on him she was afraid for sometimes it was awkward best and brightest come away poor miss giddings when he shouted that at her almost jumped out of her skin but then mrs ramsay though instantly taking his side against all the silly giddingses in the world then she thought intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh molehills on the bank then she thought stooping down to look a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours all the great men she had ever known she thought deciding that a rabbit must have got in were like that and it was good for young men though the atmosphere of lecture rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance almost simply to hear him simply to look at him but without shooting rabbits how was one to keep them down she wondered it might be a rabbit it might be a mole some creature anyhow was ruining her evening primroses and looking up she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full throbbing star and wanted to make her husband look at it for the sight gave her such keen pleasure but she stopped herself he never looked at things if he did all he would say would be poor little world with one of his sighs at that moment he said very fine to please her and pretended to admire the flowers but she knew quite well that he did not admire them or even realise that they were there it was only to please her ah but was that not lily briscoe strolling along with william bankes she focussed her short sighted eyes upon the backs of a retreating couple yes indeed it was did that not mean that they would marry yes it must what an admirable idea they must marry he had been to amsterdam mr bankes was saying as he strolled across the lawn with lily briscoe he had seen the rembrandts he had been to madrid unfortunately it was good friday and the prado was shut he had been to rome had miss briscoe never been to rome oh she should it would be a wonderful experience for her the sistine chapel michael angelo and padua with its giottos his wife had been in bad health for many years so that their sight seeing had been on a modest scale she had been to brussels she had been to paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill she had been to dresden there were masses of pictures she had not seen however lily briscoe reflected perhaps it was better not to see pictures they only made one hopelessly discontented with one own own work mr bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far we cannot all be titians and we cannot all be darwins he said at the same time he doubted whether you could have your darwin and your titian if it were not for humble people like ourselves lily would have liked to pay him a compliment you are not humble mr bankes she would have liked to have said but he did not want compliments most men do she thought and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures anyhow said lily tossing off her little insincerity she would always go on painting because it interested her yes said mr bankes he was sure she would and as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in london when they turned and saw the ramsays so that is marriage lily thought a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball that is what mrs ramsay tried to tell me the other night she thought for she was wearing a green shawl and they were standing close together watching prue and jasper throwing catches and suddenly the meaning which for no reason at all as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or ringing a doorbell descends on people making them symbolical making them representative came upon them and made them in the dusk standing looking the symbols of marriage husband and wife then after an instant the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again and they became as they met them mr and mrs ramsay watching the children throwing catches but still for a moment though mrs ramsay greeted them with her usual smile oh she is thinking we are going to get married lily thought and said i have triumphed tonight meaning that for once mr bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly still for one moment there was a sense of things having been blown apart of space of irresponsibility as the ball soared high and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches in the failing light they all looked sharp edged and ethereal and divided by great distances then darting backwards over the vast space for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand and her mother said have not they come back yet whereupon the spell was broken mr ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the lord own prayer and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study mrs ramsay bringing prue back into throwing catches again from which she had escaped asked did nancy go with them certainly nancy had gone with them since minta doyle had asked it with her dumb look holding out her hand as nancy made off after lunch to her attic to escape the horror of family life she supposed she must go then she did not want to go she did not want to be drawn into it all for as they walked along the road to the cliff minta kept on taking her hand then she would let it go then she would take it again what was it she wanted nancy asked herself there was something of course that people wanted for when minta took her hand and held it nancy reluctantly saw the whole world spread out beneath her as if it were constantinople seen through a mist and then however heavy eyed one might be one must needs ask is that santa sofia is that the golden horn so nancy asked when minta took her hand what is it that she wants is it that and what was that here and there emerged from the mist as nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her a pinnacle a dome prominent things without names but when minta dropped her hand as she did when they ran down the hillside all that the dome the pinnacle whatever it was that had protruded through the mist sank down into it and disappeared minta andrew observed was rather a good walker she wore more sensible clothes that most women she wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers she would jump straight into a stream and flounder across he liked her rashness but he saw that it would not do she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days she seemed to be afraid of nothing except bulls at the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course but she did not mind owning up to it in the least one must admit that she knew she was an awful coward about bulls she said she thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby she did not seem to mind what she said or did suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about damn your eyes damn your eyes they all had to join in and sing the chorus and shout out together damn your eyes damn your eyes but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all the good hunting grounds before they got on to the beach fatal paul agreed springing up and as they went slithering down he kept quoting the guide book about these islands being justly celebrated for their park like prospects and the extent and variety of their marine curiosities but it would not do altogether this shouting and damning your eyes andrew felt picking his way down the cliff this clapping him on the back and calling him old fellow and all that it would not altogether do it was the worst of taking women on walks once on the beach they separated he going out on to the pope own nose taking his shoes off and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves she crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber like sea anemones who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock brooding she changed the pool into the sea and made the minnows into sharks and whales and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun and so brought darkness and desolation like god himself to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down out on the pale criss crossed sand high stepping fringed gauntleted stalked some fantastic leviathan she was still enlarging the pool and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side and then letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing hypnotised and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess the pool had diminished again flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body her own life and the lives of all the people in the world for ever to nothingness so listening to the waves crouching over the pool she brooded and andrew shouted that the sea was coming in so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and there oh heavens in each other own arms were paul and minta kissing probably she was outraged indignant she and andrew put on their shoes and stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it indeed they were rather sharp with each other she might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was andrew grumbled however they both felt it is not our fault they had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen all the same it irritated andrew that nancy should be a woman and nancy that andrew should be a man and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather tight it was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother own brooch her grandmother own brooch the sole ornament she possessed a weeping willow it was they must remember it set in pearls they must have seen it she said with the tears running down her cheeks the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life now she had lost it she would rather have lost anything than that she would go back and look for it they all went back they poked and peered and looked they kept their heads very low and said things shortly and gruffly paul rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting all this pother about a brooch really did not do at all andrew thought as paul told him to make a thorough search between this point and that the tide was coming in fast the sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute there was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now we shall be cut off minta shrieked suddenly terrified as if there were any danger of that it was the same as the bulls all over again she had no control over her emotions andrew thought women had not the wretched paul had to pacify her the men andrew and paul at once became manly and different from usual took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant rayley own stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again there was nothing more that could be done now if the brooch was there it would still be there in the morning they assured her but minta still sobbed all the way up to the top of the cliff it was her grandmother own brooch she would rather have lost anything but that and yet nancy felt it might be true that she minded losing her brooch but she was not crying only for that she was crying for something else we might all sit down and cry she felt but she did not know what for they drew ahead together paul and minta and he comforted her and said how famous he was for finding things once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch he would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it it seemed to him that it would be almost dark and he would be alone on the beach and somehow it would be rather dangerous he began telling her however that he would certainly find it and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn it was lost she knew that she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon and secretly he resolved that he would not tell her but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to edinburgh and buy her another just like it but more beautiful he would prove what he could do and as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him his marriage his children his house and again he thought as they came out on to the high road which was shaded with high bushes how they would retreat into solitude together and walk on and on he always leading her and she pressing close to his side as she did now as they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through and he must tell some one mrs ramsay of course for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done it had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked minta to marry him he would go straight to mrs ramsay because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it she had made him think he could do anything nobody else took him seriously but she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted he had felt her eyes on him all day today following him about though she never said a word as if she were saying yes you can do it i believe in you i expect it of you she had made him feel all that and directly they got back he looked for the lights of the house above the bay he would go to her and say I have done it mrs ramsay thanks to you and so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows they must be awfully late then people were getting ready for dinner the house was all lit up and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full and he said to himself childishly as he walked up the drive lights lights lights and repeated in a dazed way lights lights lights as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff but good heavens he said to himself putting his hand to his tie i must not make a fool of myself yes said prue in her considering way answering her mother own question i think nancy did go with them well then nancy had gone with them mrs ramsay supposed wondering as she put down a brush took up a comb and said come in to a tap at the door jasper and rose came in whether the fact that nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen it made it less likely somehow mrs ramsay felt very irrationally except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable they could not all be drowned and again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist life jasper and rose said that mildred wanted to know whether she should wait dinner not for the queen of england said mrs ramsay emphatically not for the empress of mexico she added laughing at jasper for he shared his mother own vice he too exaggerated and if rose liked she said while jasper took the message she might choose which jewels she was to wear when there are fifteen people sitting down to dinner one cannot keep things waiting for ever she was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late it was inconsiderate of them and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them that they should choose this very night to be out late when in fact she wished the dinner to be particularly nice since william bankes had at last consented to dine with them and they were having mildred own masterpiece boeuf en daube everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready the beef the bayleaf and the wine all must be done to a turn to keep it waiting was out of the question yet of course tonight of all nights out they went and they came in late and things had to be sent out things had to be kept hot the boeuf en daube would be entirely spoilt jasper offered her an opal necklace rose a gold necklace which looked best against her black dress which did indeed said mrs ramsay absent mindedly looking at her neck and shoulders but avoiding her face in the glass and then while the children rummaged among her things she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused her the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on every time they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again because she thought the old rook the father rook old joseph was her name for him was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition he was a disreputable old bird with half his wing feathers missing he was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house look she said laughing they were actually fighting joseph and mary were fighting anyhow they all went up again and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes the movements of the wings beating out out out she could never describe it accurately enough to please herself was one of the loveliest of all to her look at that she said to rose hoping that rose would see it more clearly than she could for one own children so often gave one own own perceptions a little thrust forwards but which was it to be they had all the trays of her jewel case open the gold necklace which was italian or the opal necklace which uncle james had brought her from india or should she wear her amethysts choose dearests choose she said hoping that they would make haste but she let them take their time to choose she let rose particularly take up this and then that and hold her jewels against the black dress for this little ceremony of choosing jewels which was gone through every night was what rose liked best she knew she had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear what was the reason mrs ramsay wondered standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen divining through her own past some deep some buried some quite speechless feeling that one had for one own mother at rose own age like all feelings felt for oneself mrs ramsay thought it made one sad it was so inadequate what one could give in return and what rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was and rose would grow up and rose would suffer she supposed with these deep feelings and she said she was ready now and they would go down and jasper because he was the gentleman should give her his arm and rose as she was the lady should carry her handkerchief she gave her the handkerchief and what else oh yes it might be cold a shawl choose me a shawl she said for that would please rose who was bound to suffer so there she said stopping by the window on the landing there they are again joseph had settled on another tree top do not you think they mind she said to jasper having their wings broken why did he want to shoot poor old joseph and mary he shuffled a little on the stairs and felt rebuked but not seriously for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds and they did not feel and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world but he rather liked her stories about mary and joseph she made him laugh but how did she know that those were mary and joseph did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night he asked but here suddenly like all grown up people she ceased to pay him the least attention she was listening to a clatter in the hall they have come back she exclaimed and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved then she wondered had it happened she would go down and they would tell her but no they could not tell her anything with all these people about so she must go down and begin dinner and wait and like some queen who finding her people gathered in the hall looks down upon them and descends among them and acknowledges their tributes silently and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed she went down and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly as if she accepted what they could not say their tribute to her beauty but she stopped there was a smell of burning could they have let the boeuf en daube overboil she wondered pray heaven not when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly authoritatively that all those scattered about in attics in bedrooms on little perches of their own reading writing putting the last smooth to their hair or fastening dresses must leave all that and the little odds and ends on their washing tables and dressing tables and the novels on the bed tables and the diaries which were so private and assemble in the dining room for dinner but what have i done with my life thought mrs ramsay taking her place at the head of the table and looking at all the plates making white circles on it william sit by me she said lily she said wearily over there they had that paul rayley and minta doyle she only this an infinitely long table and plates and knives at the far end was her husband sitting down all in a heap frowning what at she did not know she did not mind she could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him she had a sense of being past everything through everything out of everything as she helped the soup as if there was an eddy there and one could be in it or one could be out of it and she was out of it it is all come to an end she thought while they came in one after another charles tansley sit there please she said augustus carmichael and sat down and meanwhile she waited passively for some one to answer her for something to happen but this is not a thing she thought ladling out soup that one says raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy that was what she was thinking this was what she was doing ladling out soup she felt more and more strongly outside that eddy or as if a shade had fallen and robbed of colour she saw things truly the room she looked round it was very shabby there was no beauty anywhere she forebore to look at mr tansley nothing seemed to have merged they all sat separate and the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her again she felt as a fact without hostility the sterility of men for if she did not do it nobody would do it and so giving herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped the old familiar pulse began beating as the watch begins ticking one two three one two three and so on and so on she repeated listening to it sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a news paper and so then she concluded addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to william bankes poor man who had no wife and no children and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight and in pity for him life being now strong enough to bear her on again she began all this business as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how had the ship sunk he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea did you find your letters i told them to put them in the hall for you she said to william bankes lily briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no man own land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon how old she looks how worn she looks lily thought and how remote then when she turned to william bankes smiling it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again and lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved why does she pity him for that was the impression she gave when she told him that his letters were in the hall poor william bankes she seemed to be saying as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people and the life in her her resolve to live again had been stirred by pity and it was not true lily thought it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people own he is not in the least pitiable he has his work lily said to herself she remembered all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure that she had her work in a flash she saw her picture and thought yes i shall put the tree further in the middle then i shall avoid that awkward space that is what i shall do that is what has been puzzling me she took up the salt cellar and put it down again on a flower pattern in the table cloth so as to remind herself to move the tree it is odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post yet one always wants one own letters said mr bankes what damned rot they talk thought charles tansley laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate which he had swept clean as if lily thought he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view he were determined to make sure of his meals everything about him had that meagre fixity that bare unloveliness but nevertheless the fact remained it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them she liked his eyes they were blue deep set frightening do you write many letters mr tansley asked mrs ramsay pitying him too lily supposed for that was true of mrs ramsay she pitied men always as if they lacked something women never as if they had something he wrote to his mother otherwise he did not suppose he wrote one letter a month said mr tansley shortly for he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by these silly women he had been reading in his room and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly superficial flimsy why did they dress he had come down in his ordinary clothes he had not got any dress clothes one never gets anything worth having by post that was the sort of thing they were always saying they made men say that sort of thing yes it was pretty well true he thought they never got anything worth having from one year own end to another they did nothing but talk talk talk eat eat eat it was the women own fault women made civilisation impossible with all their charm all their silliness no going to the lighthouse tomorrow mrs ramsay he said asserting himself he liked her he admired her he still thought of the man in the drain pipe looking up at her but he felt it necessary to assert himself he was really lily briscoe thought in spite of his eyes but then look at his nose look at his hands the most uncharming human being she had ever met then why did she mind what he said women cannot write women cannot paint what did that matter coming from him since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him and that was why he said it why did her whole being bow like corn under a wind and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great and rather painful effort she must make it once more there is the sprig on the table cloth there is my painting i must move the tree to the middle that matters nothing else could she not hold fast to that she asked herself and not lose her temper and not argue and if she wanted revenge take it by laughing at him oh mr tansley she said do take me to the lighthouse with you i should so love it she was telling lies he could see she was saying what she did not mean to annoy him for some reason she was laughing at him he was in his old flannel trousers he had no others he felt very rough and isolated and lonely he knew that she was trying to tease him for some reason she did not want to go to the lighthouse with him she despised him so did prue ramsay so did they all but he was not going to be made a fool of by women so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said all in a jerk very rudely it would be too rough for her tomorrow she would be sick it annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that with mrs ramsay listening if only he could be alone in his room working he thought among his books that was where he felt at his ease and he had never run a penny into debt he had never cost his father a penny since he was fifteen he had helped them at home out of his savings he was educating his sister still he wished he had known how to answer miss briscoe properly he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like that you would be sick he wished he could think of something to say to mrs ramsay something which would show her that he was not just a dry prig that was what they all thought him he turned to her but mrs ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to william bankes yes take it away she said briefly interrupting what she was saying to william bankes to speak to the maid it must have been fifteen no twenty years ago that i last saw her she was saying turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk for she was absorbed by what they were saying so he had actually heard from her this evening and was carrie still living at marlow and was everything still the same oh she could remember it as if it were yesterday on the river feeling it as if it were yesterday going on the river feeling very cold but if the mannings made a plan they stuck to it never should she forget herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank and it was still going on mrs ramsay mused gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing room on the banks of the thames where she had been so very very cold twenty years ago but now she went among them like a ghost and it fascinated her as if while she had changed that particular day now become very still and beautiful had remained there all these years had carrie written to him herself she asked yes she says they are building a new billiard room he said no no that was out of the question building a new billiard room it seemed to her impossible mr bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it they were very well off now should he give her love to carrie oh said mrs ramsay with a little start no she added reflecting that she did not know this carrie who built a new billiard room but how strange she repeated to mr bankes own amusement that they should be going on there still for it was extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not thought of them more than once all that time how eventful her own life had been during those same years yet perhaps carrie manning had not thought about her either the thought was strange and distasteful people soon drift apart said mr bankes feeling however some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the mannings and the ramsays he had not drifted apart he thought laying down his spoon and wiping his clean shaven lips punctiliously but perhaps he was rather unusual he thought in this he never let himself get into a groove he had friends in all circles mrs ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot that was why he preferred dining alone all those interruptions annoyed him well thought william bankes preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure such are the sacrifices one own friends ask of one it would have hurt her if he had refused to come but it was not worth it for him looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now he would have been free to work yes he thought it is a terrible waste of time the children were dropping in still i wish one of you would run up to roger own room mrs ramsay was saying how trifling it all is how boring it all is he thought compared with the other thing work here he sat drumming his fingers on the table cloth when he might have been he took a flashing bird own eye view of his work what a waste of time it all was to be sure yet he thought she is one of my oldest friends i am by way of being devoted to her yet now at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him her beauty meant nothing to him her sitting with her little boy at the window nothing nothing he wished only to be alone and to take up that book he felt uncomfortable he felt treacherous that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her the truth was that he did not enjoy family life it was in this sort of state that one asked oneself what does one live for why one asked oneself does one take all these pains for the human race to go on is it so very desirable are we attractive as a species not so very he thought looking at those rather untidy boys his favourite cam was in bed he supposed foolish questions vain questions questions one never asked if one was occupied is human life this is human life that one never had time to think about it but here he was asking himself that sort of question because mrs ramsay was giving orders to servants and also because it had struck him thinking how surprised mrs ramsay was that carrie manning should still exist that friendships even the best of them are frail things one drifts apart he reproached himself again he was sitting beside mrs ramsay and he had nothing in the world to say to her I am so sorry said mrs ramsy turning to him at last he felt rigid and barren like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them yet he must force his feet into them he must make himself talk unless he were very careful she would find out this treachery of his that he did not care a straw for her and that would not be at all pleasant he thought so he bent his head courteously in her direction how you must detest dining in this bear garden she said making use as she did when she was distracted of her social manner so when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting the chairman to obtain unity suggests that every one shall speak in french perhaps it is bad french french may not contain the words that express the speaker own thoughts nevertheless speaking french imposes some order some uniformity replying to her in the same language mr bankes said no not at all and mr tansley who had no knowledge of this language even spoke thus in words of one syllable at once suspected its insincerity they did talk nonsense he thought the ramsays and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy making a note which one of these days he would read aloud to one or two friends there in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe staying with the ramsays and what nonsense they talked it was worth while doing it once he would say but not again the women bored one so he would say of course ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children it would shape itself something like that but now at this moment sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him nothing had shaped itself at all it was all in scraps and fragments he felt extremely even physically uncomfortable he wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself he wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair looked at this person then at that person tried to break into their talk opened his mouth and shut it again they were talking about the fishing industry why did no one ask him his opinion what did they know about the fishing industry lily briscoe knew all that sitting opposite him could she not see as in an x ray photograph the ribs and thigh bones of the young man own desire to impress himself lying dark in the mist of his flesh that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation but she thought screwing up her chinese eyes and remembering how he sneered at women cannot paint cannot write why should i help him to relieve himself there is a code of behaviour she knew whose seventh article it may be says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman whatever her own occupation might be to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones the ribs of his vanity of his urgent desire to assert himself as indeed it is their duty she reflected in her old maidenly fairness to help us suppose the tube were to burst into flames then she thought i should certainly expect mr tansley to get me out but how would it be she thought if neither of us did either of these things so she sat there smiling you are not planning to go to the lighthouse are you lily said mrs ramsay remember poor mr langley he had been round the world dozens of times but he told me he never suffered as he did when my husband took him there are you a good sailor mr tansley she asked mr tansley raised a hammer swung it high in air but realising as it descended that he could not smite that butterfly with such an instrument as this said only that he had never been sick in his life but in that one sentence lay compact like gunpowder that his grandfather was a fisherman his father a chemist that he had worked his way up entirely himself that he was proud of it that he was charles tansley a fact that nobody there seemed to realise but one of these days every single person would know it he scowled ahead of him he could almost pity these mild cultivated people who would be blown sky high like bales of wool and barrels of apples one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him will you take me mr tansley said lily quickly kindly for of course if mrs ramsay said to her as in effect she did i am drowning my dear in seas of fire unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there life will run upon the rocks indeed i hear the grating and the growling at this minute my nerves are taut as fiddle strings another touch and they will snap when mrs ramsay said all this as the glance in her eyes said it of course for the hundred and fiftieth time lily briscoe had to renounce the experiment what happens if one is not nice to that young man there and be nice judging the turn in her mood correctly that she was friendly to him now he was relieved of his egotism and told her how he had been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby how his father used to fish him out with a boat hook that was how he had learnt to swim one of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the scottish coast he said he had been there with him in a storm this was said loudly in a pause they had to listen to him when he said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm ah thought lily briscoe as the conversation took this auspicious turn and she felt mrs ramsay own gratitude for mrs ramsay was free now to talk for a moment herself ah she thought but what have not i paid to get it for you she had not been sincere she had done the usual trick been nice she would never know him he would never know her human relations were all like that she thought and the worst if it had not been for mr bankes were between men and women inevitably these were extremely insincere she thought then her eye caught the salt cellar which she had placed there to remind her and she remembered that next morning she would move the tree further towards the middle and her spirits rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed out loud at what mr tansley was saying let him talk all night if he liked it but how long do they leave men on a lighthouse she asked he told her he was amazingly well informed and as he was grateful and as he liked her and as he was beginning to enjoy himself so now mrs ramsay thought she could return to that dream land that unreal but fascinating place the mannings drawing room at marlow twenty years ago where one moved about without haste or anxiety for there was no future to worry about she knew what had happened to them what to her it was like reading a good book again for she knew the end of that story since it had happened twenty years ago and life which shot down even from this dining room table in cascades heaven knows where was sealed up there and lay like a lake placidly between its banks he said they had built a billiard room was it possible would william go on talking about the mannings she wanted him to but no for some reason he was no longer in the mood she tried he did not respond she could not force him she was disappointed the children are disgraceful she said sighing he said something about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we do not acquire until later in life if at all said mrs ramsay merely to fill up space thinking what an old maid william was becoming conscious of his treachery conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate yet out of mood for it at present he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life sitting there waiting perhaps the others were saying something interesting what were they saying that the fishing season was bad that the men were emigrating they were talking about wages and unemployment the young man was abusing the government william bankes thinking what a relief it was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable heard him say something about one of the most scandalous acts of the present government lily was listening mrs ramsay was listening they were all listening but already bored lily felt that something was lacking mr bankes felt that something was lacking pulling her shawl round her mrs ramsay felt that something was lacking all of them bending themselves to listen thought pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be exposed for each thought the others are feeling this they are outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen whereas i feel nothing at all but perhaps thought mr bankes as he looked at mr tansley here is the man one was always waiting for the man there was always a chance at any moment the leader might arise the man of genius in politics as in anything else probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies thought mr bankes doing his best to make allowances for he knew by some curious physical sensation as of nerves erect in his spine that he was jealous for himself partly partly more probably for his work for his point of view for his science and therefore he was not entirely open minded or altogether fair for mr tansley seemed to be saying you have wasted your lives you are all of you wrong poor old fogies you are hopelessly behind the times he seemed to be rather cocksure this young man and his manners were bad but mr bankes bade himself observe he had courage he had ability he was extremely well up in the facts probably mr bankes thought as tansley abused the government there is a good deal in what he says tell me now he said so they argued about politics and lily looked at the leaf on the table cloth and mrs ramsay leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men wondered why she was so bored by this talk and wished looking at her husband at the other end of the table that he would say something one word she said to herself for if he said a thing it would make all the difference he went to the heart of things he cared about fishermen and their wages he could not sleep for thinking of them it was altogether different when he spoke one did not feel then pray heaven you do not see how little i care because one did care then realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him she looked at him thinking to find this in his face he would be looking magnificent but not in the least he was screwing his face up he was scowling and frowning and flushing with anger what on earth was it about she wondered what could be the matter only that poor old augustus had asked for another plate of soup that was all it was unthinkable it was detestable so he signalled to her across the table that augustus should be beginning his soup over again he loathed people eating when he had finished she saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes his brow and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode and then thank goodness she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words he sat there scowling he had said nothing he would have her observe let her give him the credit for that but why after all should poor augustus not ask for another plate of soup he had merely touched ellen own arm and said ellen please another plate of soup and then mr ramsay scowled like that and why not mrs ramsay demanded surely they could let augustus have his soup if he wanted it he hated people wallowing in food mr ramsay frowned at her he hated everything dragging on for hours like this but he had controlled himself mr ramsay would have her observe disgusting though the sight was but why show it so plainly mrs ramsay demanded they looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across each knowing exactly what the other felt everybody could see mrs ramsay thought there was rose gazing at her father there was roger gazing at his father both would be off in spasms of laughter in another second she knew and so she said promptly indeed it was time light the candles and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled at the sideboard why could he never conceal his feelings mrs ramsay wondered and she wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed perhaps he had perhaps he had not she could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there drinking his soup if he wanted soup he asked for soup whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same he did not like her she knew that but partly for that very reason she respected him and looking at him drinking soup very large and calm in the failing light and monumental and contemplative she wondered what he did feel then and why he was always content and dignified and she thought how devoted he was to andrew and would call him into his room and andrew said show him things and there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry till he reminded one of a cat watching birds and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word and her husband said poor old augustus he is a true poet which was high praise from her husband now eight candles were stood down the table and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit what had she done with it mrs ramsay wondered for rose own arrangement of the grapes and pears of the horny pink lined she will of the bananas made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea of neptune own banquet of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of bacchus in some picture among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth was like a world in which one could take one own staff and climb hills she thought and go down into valleys and to her pleasure for it brought them into sympathy momentarily she saw that augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit plunged in broke off a bloom there a tassel here and returned after feasting to his hive that was his way of looking different from hers but looking together united them now all the candles were lit up and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light and composed as they had not been in the twilight into a party round a table for the night was now shut off by panes of glass which far from giving any accurate view of the outside world rippled it so strangely that here inside the room seemed to be order and dry land there outside a reflection in which things waved and vanished waterily some change at once went through them all as if this had really happened and they were all conscious of making a party together in a hollow on an island had their common because against that fluidity out there mrs ramsay who had been uneasy waiting for paul and minta to come in and unable she felt to settle to things now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation for now they must come and lily briscoe trying to analyse the because of the sudden exhilaration compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn when solidity suddenly vanished and such vast spaces lay between them and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room and the uncurtained windows and the bright mask like look of faces seen by candlelight some weight was taken off them anything might happen she felt they must come now mrs ramsay thought looking at the door and at that instant minta doyle paul rayley and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together they were awfully late they were horribly late minta said as they found their way to different ends of the table i lost my brooch my grandmother own brooch said minta with a sound of lamentation in her voice and a suffusion in her large brown eyes looking down looking up as she sat by mr ramsay which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her how could she be such a goose he asked as to scramble about the rocks in jewels she was by way of being terrified of him he was so fearfully clever and the first night when she had sat by him and he talked about george eliot she had been really frightened for she had left the third volume of middlemarch in the train and she never knew what happened in the end but afterwards she got on perfectly and made herself out even more ignorant than she was because he liked telling her she was a fool and so tonight directly he laughed at her she was not frightened besides she knew directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened she wore her golden haze sometimes she had it sometimes not she never knew why it came or why it went or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her yes tonight she had it tremendously she knew that by the way mr ramsay told her not to be a fool she sat beside him smiling it must have happened then thought mrs ramsay they are engaged and for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again jealousy for he her husband felt it too minta own glow he liked these girls these golden reddish girls with something flying something a little wild and harum scarum about them who did not scrape their hair off were not as he said about poor lily briscoe skimpy there was some quality which she herself had not some lustre some richness which attracted him amused him led him to make favourites of girls like minta they might cut his hair from him plait him watch chains or interrupt him at his work hailing him she heard them come along mr ramsay it is our turn to beat them now and out he came to play tennis but indeed she was not jealous only now and then when she made herself look in her glass a little resentful that she had grown old perhaps by her own fault the bill for the greenhouse and all the rest of it she was grateful to them for laughing at him how many pipes have you smoked today mr ramsay and so on till he seemed a young man a man very attractive to women not burdened not weighed down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure but again as she had first known him gaunt but gallant helping her out of a boat she remembered with delightful ways like that she looked at him and he looked astonishingly young teasing minta for herself put it down there she said helping the swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the boeuf en daube for her own part she liked her boobies paul must sit by her she had kept a place for him really she sometimes thought she liked the boobies best they did not bother one with their dissertations how much they missed after all these very clever men how dried up they did become to be sure there was something she thought as he sat down very charming about paul his manners were delightful to her and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes he was so considerate would he tell her now that they were all talking again what had happened we went back to look for minta own brooch he said sitting down by her we that was enough she knew from the effort the rise in his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had said we we did this we did that they will say that all their lives she thought and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish as marthe with a little flourish took the cover off the cook had spent three days over that dish and she must take great care mrs ramsay thought diving into the soft mass to choose a specially tender piece for william bankes and she peered into the dish with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine and thought this will celebrate the occasion a curious sense rising in her at once freakish and tender of celebrating a festival as if two emotions were called up in her one profound for what could be more serious than the love of man for woman what more commanding more impressive bearing in its bosom the seeds of death at the same time these lovers these people entering into illusion glittering eyed must be danced round with mockery decorated with garlands it is a triumph said mr bankes laying his knife down for a moment he had eaten attentively it was rich it was tender it was perfectly cooked how did she manage these things in the depths of the country he asked her she was a wonderful woman all his love all his reverence had returned and she knew it it is a french recipe of my grandmother own said mrs ramsay speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice of course it was french what passes for cookery in england is an abomination they agreed it is putting cabbages in water it is roasting meat till it is like leather it is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables in which said mr bankes all the virtue of the vegetable is contained and the waste said mrs ramsay a whole french family could live on what an english cook throws away spurred on by her sense that william own affection had come back to her and that everything was all right again and that her suspense was over and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock she laughed she gesticulated till lily thought how childlike how absurd she was sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her talking about the skins of vegetables there was something frightening about her she was irresistible always she got her own way in the end lily thought now she had brought this off paul and minta one might suppose were engaged mr bankes was dining here she put a spell on them all by wishing so simply so directly and lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit and supposed that it was partly that belief for her face was all lit up without looking young she looked radiant in this strange this terrifying thing which made paul rayley sitting at her side all of a tremor yet abstract absorbed silent mrs ramsay lily felt as she talked about the skins of vegetables exalted that worshipped that held her hands over it to warm them to protect it and yet having brought it all about somehow laughed led her victims lily felt to the altar it came over her too now the emotion the vibration of love how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul own side he glowing burning she aloof satirical he bound for adventure she moored to the shore he launched incautious she solitary left out and ready to implore a share if it were a disaster in his disaster she said shyly when did minta lose her brooch he smiled the most exquisite smile veiled by memory tinged by dreams he shook his head on the beach he said I am going to find it he said I am getting up early this being kept secret from minta he lowered his voice and turned his eyes to where she sat laughing beside mr ramsay lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help him envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to pounce on the brooch half hidden by some stone and thus herself be included among the sailors and adventurers but what did he reply to her offer she actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear let me come with you and he laughed he meant yes or no either perhaps but it was not his meaning it was the odd chuckle he gave as if he had said throw yourself over the cliff if you like i do not care he turned on her cheek the heat of love its horror its cruelty its unscrupulosity it scorched her and lily looking at minta being charming to mr ramsay at the other end of the table flinched for her exposed to these fangs and was thankful for at any rate she said to herself catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern she need not marry thank heaven she need not undergo that degradation she was saved from that dilution she would move the tree rather more to the middle such was the complexity of things for what happened to her especially staying with the ramsays was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time that is what you feel was one that is what i feel was the other and then they fought together in her mind as now it is so beautiful so exciting this love that i tremble on the verge of it and offer quite out of my own habit to look for a brooch on a beach also it is the stupidest the most barbaric of human passions and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem own paul own was exquisite into a bully with a crowbar he was swaggering he was insolent in the mile end road yet she said to herself from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love wreaths heaped and roses and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this love while the women judging from her own experience would all the time be feeling this is not what we want there is nothing more tedious puerile and inhumane than this yet it is also beautiful and necessary well then well then she asked somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument as if in an argument like this one threw one own own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on so she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love then said mr bankes there is that liquid the english call coffee oh coffee said mrs ramsay but it was much rather a question she was thoroughly roused lily could see and talked very emphatically of real butter and clean milk speaking with warmth and eloquence she described the iniquity of the english dairy system and in what state milk was delivered at the door and was about to prove her charges for she had gone into the matter when all round the table beginning with andrew in the middle like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze her children laughed her husband laughed she was laughed at fire encircled and forced to veil her crest dismount her batteries and only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table to mr bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of the british public purposely however for she had it on her mind that lily who had helped her with mr tansley was out of things she exempted her from the rest said lily anyhow agrees with me and so drew her in a little fluttered a little startled for she was thinking about love they were both out of things mrs ramsay had been thinking both lily and charles tansley both suffered from the glow of the other two he it was clear felt himself utterly in the cold no woman would look at him with paul rayley in the room poor fellow still he had his dissertation the influence of somebody upon something he could take care of himself with lily it was different she faded under minta own glow became more inconspicuous than ever in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little chinese eyes everything about her was so small yet thought mrs ramsay comparing her with minta as she claimed her help for lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his boots he would talk by the hour about his boots of the two lily at forty will be the better there was in lily a thread of something a flare of something something of her own which mrs ramsay liked very much indeed but no man would she feared obviously not unless it were a much older man like william bankes but then he cared well mrs ramsay sometimes thought that he cared since his wife own death perhaps for her he was not in love of course it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many oh but nonsense she thought william must marry lily they have so many things in common lily is so fond of flowers they are both cold and aloof and rather self sufficing she must arrange for them to take a long walk together foolishly she had set them opposite each other that could be remedied tomorrow if it were fine they should go for a picnic everything seemed possible everything seemed right just now but this cannot last she thought dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots just now she had reached security she hovered like a hawk suspended like a flag floated in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly not noisily solemnly rather for it arose she thought looking at them all eating there from husband and children and friends all of which rising in this profound stillness she was helping william bankes to one very small piece more and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot seemed now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke like a fume rising upwards holding them safe together nothing need be said nothing could be said there it was all round them it partook she felt carefully helping mr bankes to a specially tender piece of eternity as she had already felt about something different once before that afternoon there is a coherence in things a stability something she meant is immune from change and shines out she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights in the face of the flowing the fleeting the spectral like a ruby so that again tonight she had the feeling she had had once today already of peace of rest of such moments she thought the thing is made that endures yes she assured william bankes there is plenty for everybody andrew she said hold your plate lower or i shall spill it the boeuf en daube was a perfect triumph here she felt putting the spoon down where one could move or rest could wait now they were all helped listening could then like a hawk which lapses suddenly from its high station flaunt and sink on laughter easily resting her whole weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty three that was the number it seemed on his watch what did it all mean to this day she had no notion a square root what was that her sons knew she leant on them on cubes and square roots that was what they were talking about now on voltaire and madame de stael on the character of napoleon on the french system of land tenure on lord rosebery on creevey own memoirs she let it uphold her and sustain her this admirable fabric of the masculine intelligence which ran up and down crossed this way and that like iron girders spanning the swaying fabric upholding the world so that she could trust herself to it utterly even shut her eyes or flicker them for a moment as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the leaves of a tree then she woke up it was still being fabricated william bankes was praising the waverly novels he read one of them every six months he said and why should that make charles tansley angry he rushed in all thought mrs ramsay because prue will not be nice to him and denounced the waverly novels when he knew nothing about it nothing about it whatsoever mrs ramsay thought observing him rather than listening to what he said she could see how it was from his manner he wanted to assert himself and so it would always be with him till he got his professorship or married his wife and so need not be always saying i i i for that was what his criticism of poor sir walter or perhaps it was jane austen amounted to i i i he was thinking of himself and the impression he was making as she could tell by the sound of his voice and his emphasis and his uneasiness success would be good for him at any rate they were off again now she need not listen it could not last she knew but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people and their thoughts and their feelings without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging trembling so she saw them she heard them but whatever they said had also this quality as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when at the same time one can see the ripple and the gravel something to the right something to the left and the whole is held together for whereas in active life she would be netting and separating one thing from another she would be saying she liked the waverly novels or had not read them she would be urging herself forward now she said nothing for the moment she hung suspended ah but how long do you think it will last said somebody it was as if she had antennae trembling out from her which intercepting certain sentences forced them upon her attention this was one of them she scented danger for her husband a question like that would lead almost certainly to something being said which reminded him of his own failure how long would he be read he would think at once william bankes who was entirely free from all such vanity laughed and said he attached no importance to changes in fashion who could tell what was going to last in literature or indeed in anything else let us enjoy what we do enjoy he said his integrity seemed to mrs ramsay quite admirable he never seemed for a moment to think but how does this affect me but then if you had the other temperament which must have praise which must have encouragement naturally you began and she knew that mr ramsay was beginning to be uneasy to want somebody to say oh but your work will last mr ramsay or something like that he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying with some irritation that anyhow scott or was it shakespeare would last him his lifetime he said it irritably everybody she thought felt a little uncomfortable without knowing why then minta doyle whose instinct was fine said bluffly absurdly that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading shakespeare mr ramsay said grimly but his mind was turned away again that very few people liked it as much as they said they did but he added there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless and mrs ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow he would laugh at minta and she mrs ramsay saw realising his extreme anxiety about himself would in her own way see that he was taken care of and praise him somehow or other but she wished it was not necessary perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary anyhow she was free now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy they lasted he said he had read some of tolstoi at school there was one he always remembered but he had forgotten the name russian names were impossible said mrs ramsay vronsky said paul he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain vronsky said mrs ramsay oh anna karenina but that did not take them very far books were not in their line no charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books but it was all so mixed up with am i saying the right thing am i making a good impression that after all one knew more about him than about tolstoi whereas what paul said was about the thing simply not himself nothing else like all stupid people he had a kind of modesty too a consideration for what you were feeling which once in a way at least she found attractive now he was thinking not about himself or about tolstoi but whether she was cold whether she felt a draught whether she would like a pear no she said she did not want a pear indeed she had been keeping guard over the dish of fruit without realising it jealously hoping that nobody would touch it her eyes had been going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit among the rich purples of the lowland grapes then over the horny ridge of the she will putting a yellow against a purple a curved shape against a round shape without knowing why she did it or why every time she did it she felt more and more serene until oh what a pity that they should do it a hand reached out took a pear and spoilt the whole thing in sympathy she looked at rose she looked at rose sitting between jasper and prue how odd that one own child should do that how odd to see them sitting there in a row her children jasper rose prue andrew almost silent but with some joke of their own going on she guessed from the twitching at their lips it was something quite apart from everything else something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room it was not about their father she hoped no she thought not what was it she wondered sadly rather for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there there was all that hoarded behind those rather set still mask like faces for they did not join in easily they were like watchers surveyors a little raised or set apart from the grown up people but when she looked at prue tonight she saw that this was not now quite true of her she was just beginning just moving just descending the faintest light was on her face as if the glow of minta opposite some excitement some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table cloth and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it she kept looking at minta shyly yet curiously so that mrs ramsay looked from one to the other and said speaking to prue in her own mind you will be as happy as she is one of these days you will be much happier she added because you are my daughter she meant her own daughter must be happier than other people own daughters but dinner was over it was time to go they were only playing with things on their plates she would wait until they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling he was having a joke with minta about a bet then she would get up she liked charles tansley she thought suddenly she liked his laugh she liked him for being so angry with paul and minta she liked his awkwardness there was a lot in that young man after all and lily she thought putting her napkin beside her plate she always has some joke of her own one need never bother about lily she waited she tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate well were they done now no that story had led to another story her husband was in great spirits tonight and wishing she supposed to make it all right with old augustus after that scene about the soup had drawn him in they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college she looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral for she did not listen to the words the sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice minta own speaking alone reminded her of men and boys crying out the latin words of a service in some roman catholic cathedral she waited her husband spoke he was repeating something and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring of exultation and melancholy in his voice come out and climb the garden path luriana lurilee the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee the words she was looking at the window sounded as if they were floating like flowers on water out there cut off from them all as if no one had said them but they had come into existence of themselves and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves she did not know what they meant but like music the words seemed to be spoken by her own voice outside her self saying quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said different things she knew without looking round that every one at the table was listening to the voice saying i wonder if it seems to you luriana lurilee with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had as if this were at last the natural thing to say this were their own voice speaking but the voice had stopped she looked round she made herself get up augustus carmichael had risen and holding his table napkin so that it looked like a long white robe he stood chanting to see the kings go riding by over lawn and daisy lea with their palm leaves and cedar luriana lurilee and as she passed him he turned slightly towards her repeating the last words luriana lurilee and bowed to her as if he did her homage without knowing why she felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before and with a feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and passed through the door which he held open for her it was necessary now to carry everything a step further with her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked and then as she moved and took minta own arm and left the room it changed it shaped itself differently it had become she knew giving one last look at it over her shoulder already the past as usual lily thought there was always something that had to be done at that precise moment something that mrs ramsay had decided for reasons of her own to do instantly it might be with every one standing about making jokes as now not being able to decide whether they were going into the smoking room into the drawing room up to the attics then one saw mrs ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with minta own arm in hers bethink her yes it is time for that now and so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone and directly she went a sort of disintegration set in they wavered about went different ways mr bankes took charles tansley by the arm and went off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner about politics thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening making the weight fall in a different direction as if lily thought seeing them go and hearing a word or two about the policy of the labour party they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were taking their bearings the change from poetry to politics struck her like that so mr bankes and charles mrs ramsay going upstairs in the lamplight alone where lily wondered was she going so quickly not that she did in fact run or hurry she went indeed rather slowly she felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter and pick out one particular thing the thing that mattered to detach it separate it off clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things and so hold it before her and bring it to the tribunal where ranged about in conclave sat the judges she had set up to decide these things is it good is it bad is it right or wrong where are we all going to and so on so she righted herself after the shock of the event and quite unconsciously and incongruously used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position her world was changing they were still the event had given her a sense of movement all must be in order she must get that right and that right she thought insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees stillness and now again of the superb upward rise like the beak of a ship up a wave of the elm branches as the wind raised them for it was windy she stood a moment to look out it was windy so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves yes that was done then accomplished and as with all things done became solemn now one thought of it cleared of chatter and emotion it seemed always to have been only was shown now and so being shown struck everything into stability they would she thought going on again however long they lived come back to this night this moon this wind this house and to her too it flattered her where she was most susceptible of flattery to think how wound about in their hearts however long they lived she would be woven and this and this and this she thought going upstairs laughing but affectionately at the sofa on the landing her mother own at the rocking chair her father own at the map of the hebrides all that would be revived again in the lives of paul and minta the rayleys she tried the new name over and she felt with her hand on the nursery door that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically the feeling was one of relief and happiness it was all one stream and chairs tables maps were hers were theirs it did not matter whose and paul and minta would carry it on when she was dead she turned the handle firmly lest it should squeak and went in pursing her lips slightly as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud but directly she came in she saw with annoyance that the precaution was not needed the children were not asleep it was most annoying mildred should be more careful there was james wide awake and cam sitting bolt upright and mildred out of bed in her bare feet and it was almost eleven and they were all talking what was the matter it was that horrid skull again she had told mildred to move it but mildred of course had forgotten and now there was cam wide awake and james wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours ago what had possessed edward to send them this horrid skull she had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there it was nailed fast mildred said and cam could not go to sleep with it in the room and james screamed if she touched it then cam must go to sleep it had great horns said cam must go to sleep and dream of lovely palaces said mrs ramsay sitting down on the bed by her side she could see the horns cam said all over the room it was true wherever they put the light and james could not sleep without a light there was always a shadow somewhere but think cam it is only an old pig said mrs ramsay a nice black pig like the pigs at the farm but cam thought it was a horrid thing branching at her all over the room well then said mrs ramsay we will cover it up and they all watched her go to the chest of drawers and open the little drawers quickly one after another and not seeing anything that would do she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the skull round and round and round and then she came back to cam and laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside cam own and said how lovely it looked now how the fairies would love it it was like a bird own nest it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen abroad with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and antelopes and she could see the words echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in cam own mind and cam was repeating after her how it was like a mountain a bird own nest a garden and there were little antelopes and her eyes were opening and shutting and mrs ramsay went on speaking still more monotonously and more rhythmically and more nonsensically how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens and everything lovely she said raising her head very slowly and speaking more and more mechanically until she sat upright and saw that cam was asleep now she whispered crossing over to his bed james must go to sleep too for see she said the boar own skull was still there they had not touched it they had done just what he wanted it was there quite unhurt he made sure that the skull was still there under the shawl but he wanted to ask her something more would they go to the lighthouse tomorrow no not tomorrow she said but soon she promised him the next fine day he was very good he lay down she covered him up but he would never forget she knew and she felt angry with charles tansley with her husband and with herself for she had raised his hopes then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the boar own skull she got up and pulled the window down another inch or two and heard the wind and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured good night to mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out she hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their heads she thought still thinking how annoying charles tansley was for neither of them slept well they were excitable children and since he said things like that about the lighthouse it seemed to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over just as they were going to sleep clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow for she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work yet he looked so desolate yet she would feel relieved when he went yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow yet he was admirable with her husband yet his manners certainly wanted improving yet she liked his laugh thinking this as she came downstairs she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase window the yellow harvest moon and turned and they saw her standing above them on the stairs that is my mother thought prue yes minta should look at her paul rayley should look at her that is the thing itself she felt as if there were only one person like that in the world her mother and from having been quite grown up a moment before talking with the others she became a child again and what they had been doing was a game and would her mother sanction their game or condemn it she wondered and thinking what a chance it was for minta and paul and lily to see her and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her to have her and how she would never grow up and never leave home she said like a child we thought of going down to the beach to watch the waves instantly for no reason at all mrs ramsay became like a girl of twenty full of gaiety a mood of revelry suddenly took possession of her of course they must go of course they must go she cried laughing and running down the last three or four steps quickly she began turning from one to the other and laughing and drawing minta own wrap round her and saying she only wished she could come too and would they be very late and had any of them got a watch yes paul has said minta paul slipped a beautiful gold watch out of a little wash leather case to show her and as he held it in the palm of his hand before her he felt she knows all about it i need not say anything he was saying to her as he showed her the watch I have done it mrs ramsay i owe it all to you and seeing the gold watch lying in his hand mrs ramsay felt how extraordinarily lucky minta is she is marrying a man who has a gold watch in a wash leather bag how i wish i could come with you she cried but she was withheld by something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what it was of course it was impossible for her to go with them but she would have liked to go had it not been for the other thing and tickled by the absurdity of her thought how lucky to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch she went with a smile on her lips into the other room where her husband sat reading of course she said to herself coming into the room she had to come here to get something she wanted first she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp but she wanted something more though she did not know could not think what it was that she wanted she looked at her husband taking up her stocking and beginning to knit and saw that he did not want to be interrupted that was clear he was reading something that moved him very much he was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion he was tossing the pages over he was acting it perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter own she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above had been saying that people do not read scott any more then her husband thought that is what they will say of me so he went and got one of those books and if he came to the conclusion that is true what charles tansley said he would accept it about scott she could see that he was weighing considering putting this with that as he read but not about himself he was always uneasy about himself that troubled her he would always be worrying about his own books will they be read are they good why are not they better what do people think of me not liking to think of him so and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting wondering if the children were laughing at that she twitched the stockings out and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now when the breeze falls settles leaf by leaf into quiet it did not matter any of it she thought a great man a great book fame who could tell she knew nothing about it but it was his way with him his truthfulness for instance at dinner she had been thinking quite instinctively if only he would speak she had complete trust in him and dismissing all this as one passes in diving now a weed now a straw now a bubble she felt again sinking deeper as she had felt in the hall when the others were talking there is something i want something i have come to get and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was with her eyes closed and she waited a little knitting wondering and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically and as they washed words like little shaded lights one red one blue one yellow lit up in the dark of her mind and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across or to cry out and to be echoed so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves she murmured sticking her needles into the stocking and she opened the book and began reading here and there at random and as she did so she felt that she was climbing backwards upwards shoving her way up under petals that curved over her so that she only knew this is white or this is red she did not know at first what the words meant at all steer hither steer your winged pines all beaten mariners she read and turned the page swinging herself zigzagging this way and that from one line to another as from one branch to another from one red and white flower to another until a little sound roused her her husband slapping his thighs their eyes met for a second but they did not want to speak to each other they had nothing to say but something seemed nevertheless to go from him to her it was the life it was the power of it it was the tremendous humour she knew that made him slap his thighs do not interrupt me he seemed to be saying do not say anything just sit there and he went on reading his lips twitched it filled him it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they did not exist at all but now he felt it did not matter a damn who reached z if thought ran like an alphabet from a to z somebody would reach it if not he then another this man own strength and sanity his feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit own cottage made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott own hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie own drowning and mucklebackit own sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter he felt that he had been arguing with somebody and had got the better of him they could not improve upon that whatever they might say and his own position became more secure the lovers were fiddlesticks he thought collecting it all in his mind again that is fiddlesticks that is first rate he thought putting one thing beside another but he must read it again he could not remember the whole shape of the thing he had to keep his judgement in suspense so he returned to the other thought if young men did not care for this naturally they did not care for him either one ought not to complain thought mr ramsay trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him but he was determined he would not bother her again here he looked at her reading she looked very peaceful reading he liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the english novel and the french novel mrs ramsay raised her head and like a person in a light sleep seemed to say that if he wanted her to wake she would she really would but otherwise might she go on sleeping just a little longer just a little longer she was climbing up those branches this way and that laying hands on one flower and then another nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose she read and so reading she was ascending she felt on to the top on to the summit how satisfying how restful all the odds and ends of the day stuck to this magnet her mind felt swept felt clean and then there it was suddenly entire she held it in her hands beautiful and reasonable clear and complete here the sonnet but she was becoming conscious of her husband looking at her he was smiling at her quizzically as if he were ridiculing her gently for being asleep in broad daylight but at the same time he was thinking go on reading you do not look sad now he thought and he wondered what she was reading and exaggerated her ignorance her simplicity for he liked to think that she was not clever not book learned at all he wondered if she understood what she was reading probably not he thought she was astonishingly beautiful her beauty seemed to him if that were possible to increase yet seem d it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play she finished well she said echoing his smile dreamily looking up from her book as with your shadow i with these did play she murmured putting the book on the table what had happened she wondered as she took up her knitting since she had seen him alone she remembered dressing and seeing the moon andrew holding his plate too high at dinner being depressed by something william had said the birds in the trees the sofa on the landing the children being awake charles tansley waking them with his books falling oh no that she had invented and paul having a wash leather case for his watch which should she tell him about they are engaged she said beginning to knit paul and minta so i guessed he said there was nothing very much to be said about it her mind was still going up and down up and down with the poetry he was still feeling very vigorous very forthright after reading about steenie own funeral so they sat silent then she became aware that she wanted him to say something anything anything she thought going on with her knitting anything will do how nice it would be to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch she said for that was the sort of joke they had together he snorted he felt about this engagement as he always felt about any engagement the girl is much too good for that young man slowly it came into her head why is it then that one wants people to marry what was the value the meaning of things every word they said now would be true do say something she thought wishing only to hear his voice for the shadow the thing folding them in was beginning she felt to close round her again say anything she begged looking at him as if for help he was silent swinging the compass on his watch chain to and fro and thinking of scott own novels and balzac own novels but through the crepuscular walls of their intimacy for they were drawing together involuntarily coming side by side quite close she could feel his mind like a raised hand shadowing her mind and he was beginning now that her thoughts took a turn he disliked towards this pessimism as he called it to fidget though he said nothing raising his hand to his forehead twisting a lock of hair letting it fall again you will not finish that stocking tonight he said pointing to her stocking that was what she wanted the asperity in his voice reproving her if he says it is wrong to be pessimistic probably it is wrong she thought the marriage will turn out all right no she said flattening the stocking out upon her knee i shall not finish it and what then for she felt that he was still looking at her but that his look had changed he wanted something wanted the thing she always found it so difficult to give him wanted her to tell him that she loved him and that no she could not do he found talking so much easier than she did he could say things she never could so naturally it was always he that said the things and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly and would reproach her a heartless woman he called her she never told him that she loved him but it was not so it was not so it was only that she never could say what she felt was there no crumb on his coat nothing she could do for him getting up she stood at the window with the reddish brown stocking in her hands partly to turn away from him partly because she remembered how beautiful it often is the sea at night but she knew that he had turned his head as she turned he was watching her she knew that he was thinking you are more beautiful than ever and she felt herself very beautiful will you not tell me just for once that you love me he was thinking that for he was roused what with minta and his book and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the lighthouse but she could not do it she could not say it then knowing that he was watching her instead of saying anything she turned holding her stocking and looked at him and as she looked at him she began to smile for though she had not said a word he knew of course he knew that she loved him he could not deny it and smiling she looked out of the window and said thinking to herself nothing on earth can equal this happiness yes you were right it is going to be wet tomorrow you will not be able to go and she looked at him smiling for she had triumphed again she had not said it yet he knew'"
